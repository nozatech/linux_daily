### Special Shell Variables ###
	$0 		file name of script
	$1		positional parameter #1
	$2-9	positional parameter #2-9
	${10}	positional parameter #10
	$#		number of positional parameter
	"$*"	all the positional parameters(as separate word)*
	"$@"	all the positional parameters(as separate strings)
	${#*}	number of positional parameters
	${#@}	number of positional parameters
	$?		return value
	$$	 	process ID(PID) of script
	$-		flags passed to script(using set)
	$_		last argument of previous command
	$!		process ID(PID) of last job run in background
	* Must be quoted, otherwise it defaults to $@


$ echo -n     do not output the trailing newline
       -e     enable interpretation of backslash escapes
       -E     disable interpretation of backslash escapes (default)

### "2>&1" command:
	Using "2>&1" , redirect the standard error(2) to standard output(1). The string "2>&1" indicates that any errors 
	should be sent to the standard output(1), that is, the UNIX/Linux file id of 2 for standard error, and the file 
	id of 1 for standard output. 
	If you do not use this string, then you will be capturing only the good messages, and the error messages will not be captured.

whitespace (spaces or tabs).

######################################################################################################################################
# Bash Scripting
######################################################################################################################################
These are positional arguments of the script. 
position of arguments passed to the script on the command line, not line numbers
#!/bin/sh
echo "$1"
echo "$2"

./script.sh Hello World
$0 = script.sh             <- File name of the current script
$1 = Hello
$2 = World	
	
The $@ variable expands to all the parameters used when calling the function

function foo()
{
    echo "$@"
}

foo 1 2 3

It would display 1 2 3. If not used inside a function, it specifies all parameters 
used when calling the script. See the bash manual page for more info.	
	
The shell treats several parameters specially. These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.

*
($*) Print all the parameter.
	 Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion is not within double quotes, 
     each positional parameter expands to a separate word. In contexts where it is performed, those words are 
	 subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, 
	 it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS 
	 special variable. That is, "$*" is equivalent to "$1c$2c…", where c is the first character of the value 
	 of the IFS variable. If IFS is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If IFS is null, the parameters 
	 are joined without intervening separators.

@
($@) Individually double quoted 
	Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, 
	each parameter expands to a separate word. That is, "$@" is equivalent to "$1" "$2" …. If the double-quoted 
	expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the 
	original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. 
	When there are no positional parameters, "$@" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).

#
($#) Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal(Counts number of parameters).	
 
($?) Exit status of the last command
	0 - successful
	1 - fail
($$) Process ID under which order getting executed

(?!) Process number of the last background command
 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World. Calls $# of parameters"	
echo "argument 0 is '$0'"
.....	
echo "argument 9 is '$9'"
echo "argument 10 is '{$10}'"	 # from 10, use {} 

./argument.sh a b ... y z
		Hello, World. Calls 24 of parameters
		argument 0 is './argument.sh'
		argument 1 is 'a'
		.....
		argument 10 is 'j'
	
	
79.Special parameters

The shell treats several parameters specially. These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.

Table 3-3. Special bash variables

Character	Definition
$*	Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion 
	occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each 
	parameter separated by the first character of the IFS special variable.
$@	Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs 
	within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.
$#	Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
$?	Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
$-	A hyphen expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the 
	set built-in command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the -i).
$$	Expands to the process ID of the shell.
$!	Expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background (asynchronous)
	 command.
$0	Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.
$_	The underscore variable is set at shell startup and contains the absolute file name 
	of the shell or script being executed as passed in the argument list. Subsequently, 
	it expands to the last argument to the previous command, after expansion. It is also
	set to the full pathname of each command executed and placed in the environment 
	exported to that command. When checking mail, this parameter holds the name of the 
	mail file.


	grep "echo" ./function1.sh

### Questions ###
#################

1: What is a shell?
	Shell is a interface between user and the kernel. Even though there can be  only one kernel ; 
	a system can have many shell running simultaneously . Whenever  a user enters a command  through 
	keyboard the shell communicates with the kernel  to execute it and then display the output to the user.

4:What is the difference between soft and hard links?
	Soft links are link to the file name and can reside on different filesytem as well; 
	however hard links are link to the inode of the file and has to be on the 
	same filesytem as that of the file. Deleting the orginal file makes the soft link inactive 
	(broken link) but does not affect the hard link (Hard link will still access a copy of the file)
	e.g. ln source dest_file
		 ln -s source dest_file

5: How will you pass and access arguments to a script in Linux?
	scriptName “Arg1” “Arg2”….”Argn” and can be accessed inside the script as $1 , $2 .. $n

6: What is the significance of $#?

	$# shows the total counts of the arguments passed to the script.
	e.g. $# out puts like wc -l 
	
	
7: What is the difference between $* and $@?
	$@ treats each quoted arguments as separate arguments  
	$* will consider the entire set of positional parameters as a single string.

8: Use sed command to replace the content of the file (emulate tac command)
if cat file1
ABCD
EFGH

Then O/p should be
EFGH
ABCD


sed '1! G; h;$!d' file1

Here G command appends to the pattern space,

h command copies pattern buffer to hold buffer

and d command deletes the current pattern  space.

9: Given a file,  replace all occurrence of word “ABC” with “DEF” from 5th line till end in only those lines that contains word “MNO”


sed –n ‘5,$p’ file1|sed ‘/MNO/s/ABC/DEF/’
 

10: Given a file , write a command sequence to find the count of each word.


tr –s  “(backslash)040” <file1|tr –s  “(backslash)011”|tr “(backslash)040 (backslash)011” “(backslash)012” |uniq –c

where “(backslash)040” is octal equivalent of “space”
1
2
3
tr –s  “(backslash)040” <file1|tr –s  “(backslash)011”|tr “(backslash)040 (backslash)011” “(backslash)012” |uniq –c
 
where “(backslash)040” is octal equivalent of “space”
 

”(backslash)011” is octal equivalent of “tab character” and

“(backslash)012” is octal equivalent of newline character.

11: How will you find the 99th line of a file using only tail and head command?

tail +99 file1|head -1


12: Print the 10th line without using tail and head command.
sed –n ‘10p’ file1


13:In my bash shell I want my prompt to be of format  ‘$”Present working directory”:”hostname”>  and load a file containing a list of user defined functions as soon as I login , how will you automate this?

	In bash shell we can create “.profile”  file which automatically gets invoked as soon as I login and write the following syntax into it.

	export PS1=’$ `pwd`:`hostname`>’ .File1

 
Here File1 is the file containing the user defined functions and “.” invokes this file in current shell.

14: Explain about “s” permission bit in a file?

“s” bit is called “set user id” (SUID) bit.

“s” bit on a file causes the process to have the privileges of the owner of the file during the instance of the program.

Eg: Executing “passwd” command to change current password causes the user to writes its new password to shadow file even though it has “root” as its owner.

15: I want to create a directory such that anyone in the group can create a file and access any person’s file in it but none should be able to delete a file other than the one created by himself.

We can create the directory giving read and execute access to everyone in the group and setting its sticky bit “t” on as follows:


mkdir direc1

chmod g+wx direc1

chmod +t direc1
1
2
3
4
5
mkdir direc1
 
chmod g+wx direc1
 
chmod +t direc1
 

16: How can you find out how long the system has been running?

Command “uptime”

17: How can any user find out all information about a specific user like his default shell, real life name, default directory,when and how long he has been using the sytem?

finger  “loginName”                  …where loginName is the  login name of  the

user whose  information is expected.

18: What is the difference between $$ and $!?

$$ gives the process id of the currently executing process whereas $! shows the process id of the process that recently went into background.

19: What are zombie processes?

These are the processes which have died but whose exit status is still not picked by the parent process. These processes even if not functional still have its process id entry in the process table.

20: How will you copy file from one machine to other?
	”scp” or “rsync” to copy file from one machine to other.


26: What are the 3 standard streams in Linux?
	0 – Standard Input
	1 – Standard Output
	2 – Standard Error

27: I want to read all input to the command from file1 direct all output to file2 and error to file3?
	command < file1   1 > file2    2 > file3

28: What will happen to my current process when I execute a command using exec?
	“exec” overlays the newly forked process on the current  process; so when I execute the command using exec, 
	the command gets executed on the current shell without creating any new processes. 
	### Then DISCONNECT SSH connection!!!

	Eg: Executing “exec  ls”  on command prompt will execute ls and once ls exits, the process will shut down

29: How will you emulate wc –l using awk?
	awk ‘END {print NR} fileName’


31: What is the difference between grep and egrep?
	Extended grep that supports added grep features like “+” (1 or more occurrence of previous character),
	”?”(0 or 1 occurrence of previous character) and “|” (alternate matching)

32: How will you print the login names of all users on a system?
	/etc/shadow file has all the users listed.
	awk –F ‘:’ ‘{print $1} /etc/shadow’|uniq -u

33: How to set an array in bash?
	A=(element1 element2 element3 …. element)

   

37:What is the significance of "$?" ?
	$? gives the exit status of the last command that was executed.

38: How do we delete all blank lines in a file?

	sed  ‘^ [\011\040]*$/d’ file1
 
		011 is octal equivalent of space
		040 is octal equivalent of tab

39: How will I insert a line “ABCDEF” at every 100th line of a file?
	sed ‘100i\ABCDEF’ file1

40: Write a command sequence to find all the files modified in less than 2 days and print the record count of each.
	find . –mtime -2 –exec wc –l {} \;

41: How can I set the default rwx permission to all users on  every file which is created in the current shell?
	umask 777

42: How can we find the process name from its process id?
	“ps –p ProcessId”

43: What are the four fundamental components of every file system on linux?
	bootblock, super block, inode block and  data block

44: What is a boot block?
	This block contains a small program called “Master Boot record”(MBR) which loads the kernel  during system boot up.

45: What is a super block?
	Super block contains all the information about the file system like size of file system, block size used by it,
	number of free data blocks and list of free inodes and data blocks.

46: What is an inode block?
	This block contains the inode for every file of the file system along with all the file attributes except its name.

49: What are “c” and “b” permission fields of a file?
“c “ and “b” permission fields are generally associated with a device file. It specifies whether a file is a character special file or a block special file.
