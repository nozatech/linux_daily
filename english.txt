현재완료에서 been은 어떨 때 쓰나요? been이 어떻게 사용 
되는지 여러 가지 예문을 통해 자세히 알려주세요. 

안녕하세요? been은 말 그대로 be 동사가 현재완료의 have p.p.안에서 
쓰일 때 p.p.형으로 쓰인 겁니다. 자세히 알아볼까요? 


been은 말 그대로 be 동사가 현재완료의 have p.p. 안에서 쓰일 때, 
p.p.형으로 쓰인 겁니다. 그러므로 be 동사가 쓰이는 곳은 모두 쓰인다고 보면 되는 거죠. 

1) 현재완료진행으로 쓰일 때 

* She has been reading a book all day. (그녀는 하루 내내 책을 읽어왔다.) 
“~ 해오고 있다“ 라는 뜻을 나타내는 위와 같은 문장을, “현재완료진행시제”라고 합니다. 

일단 현재 완료 진행을 이해하기 위해서, 진행 시제에 대해서 알아 볼까요? 
여러분은! 진행 시제를 어떻게 쓰나요? 
그렇죠, be동사 + ing 의 형태입니다. 

* I am doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 하고 있습니다.) 
이런 것이 현재 진행 시제이죠. 여러분은! 현재 완료는 어떻게 쓰나요? 
그렇죠, have + p.p 의 형태입니다. 

그럼 현재완료 진행은 어떻게 쓸까요? 말 그대로, 현재완료 진행은 
현재완료 + 현재 진행 입니다. 
have + p.p + be동사 + ing = have + been(be동사의 p.p형태) + ~ing 입니다. 
뜻은 “~ 해 오고 있다” 로, 진행의 느낌이 있을 때 쓰는 거구요. 

그렇다면, 위의 문장으로, 현재완료진행 시제를 만들어 봅시다. 
* I am doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 하고 있습니다.) 
-> I have been doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 해 오고 있습니다.) 
어떤가요? 쉽지 않나요? ^-^ 

2) ~ 있다. 는 be 동사의 의미를 살려서 쓸 때 

현재완료는 be 동사에서도 똑같이 적용되어, is, are, am 등이 
have(has) + been 으로 바뀐다는 것을 알면 이해하기가 쉬울 거예요. 

예문으로 보면, 
* It has been very hot since last week. (지난 주부터 아주 더워왔다) 
이 문장을 보면, 간단히 현재완료시제의 문장 이예요. 
일단, “ 덥다 ” 라는 문장을 보면 It is hot. 이죠. 
현재완료 형태로 바꾸면 is 가 has been 이 되어서 It has been hot. 이 됩니다. 

※이와 관련해서, 날씨에 관한 현재완료 표현을 많이 질문 하시는데요, 
* It has been rainy since last Sunday. 
* It has rained since last Sunday. 
이 두 예문을 봅시다. 둘다 ‘저번 주 일요일 이후로 계속 비가 왔다’는 의미인데요. 
이 두 문장을 보고, “ been을 어디에는 붙이고 어디에는 안 붙이나요? “ 
하고 묻는 학생들이 있습니다. 

위 문장들에서는 been 을 붙이고 안 붙이고의 문제가 아니고, 
먼저 알아둬야 할 것은, “무엇이 동사인가” 하는 것 같네요. 

위의 첫 번째 문장을 봅시다. 
It has been rainy since last Sunday. (저번 주 일요일 이후로 계속 비가 오고 있다.) 
이 문장을 현재형으로 바꾸면 어떤 문장이 될까요? 
It is rainy. (비가 옵니다) 이지요? 
be 동사가 본동사인 문장이지요? 그렇기 때문에, is 가 has been 으로 변합니다. 

두 번째 문장을 보면, 
It has rained since last Sunday. (저번 주 일요일 이후로 비가 와 왔다.) 
이 문장의 현재형은 It rains. (비가 옵니다.) 이지요? 
rains 가 본동사 이므로, has rained 로 변형됩니다. 
동사가 be동사인 현재형 문장을 현재완료형으로 바꾸면, 
has(have) been 이 되는 거고, 동사가 일반 동사인 현재형 문장을 
현재완료형으로 바꾸면, have(has) + 일반 동사의 p.p 가 됩니다. 

3) “~에 갔다 오다”라는 뜻으로 쓸 때. be동사는 “~이다“ 
혹은 ”~있다“란 의미입니다. 

하지만, be 동사가 p.p. 형으로 쓰이면 go and come 
즉, “갔다 왔다“의 의미를 갖게 됩니다. 
왜 그런지 그 의미를 추측 해 봅시다. 

* I have been to New York. 이란 문장을 보면, 지금 내가 여기에서 
이야기 하고 있는데, “뉴욕에도 있었다.”란 문장을 썼으니, 
아~ 그렇다면, 뉴욕에 갔다고 온 것이군. 이란 의미가 되는 게 아닌가 싶습니다. 



"have been to"는 하나의 숙어처럼 
" ~에 갔다 왔다" 혹은 "~에 가본 적이 있다"란 말로 굳혀져서 사용하는 문구 입니다. 

하지만, be 동사가 p.p. 형 일 때만 
go and come 의 의미를 갖고, 
그냥 be동사는 ~이다, ~있다의 
의미만 갖습니다. 

그러므로 “ 나는 뉴욕에 갔다.“ 라고 
말하고 싶다면 be 동사가 아니라 
I went to New York. 이라고 말해야 합니다. 


마지막으로 been은 현재완료 수동태 문장을 만들 때도 사용됩니다. 

수동태는 be + p.p 형태를 취하므로 현재완료 수동태를 만들 때는 
be동사 역할을 하는 been이 와야 합니다. 

예를 들어, 
We have polluted water. 현재 완료 문장을 현재완료 수동태로 고치려고 한다면 
Water has been polluted by us. 의 형태가 될 수 있겠죠. 
현재완료 have p.p + 수동태 be p.p 가 합쳐져서 have been p.p의 형태가 되는 거죠.

현재
현재동사 (동사의 원형)
I get up at 6 every morning.
현재 시제의 진짜 의미
현재 시제라고해서 지금 일어나고 있는 상황을 꼭 이야기 하고 있는 것은 아닙니다.
이런 경우는 현재 진행형을 더 많이 사용하게 됩니다.
현재 시제는 과거에도 그렇고, 현재에도 그렇고, 미래에도 그럴것이라는 것을 말하고 있습니다.
현재 시제를 사용하는 5가지 상황
1. 일반적인 사실, 불변의 진리를 말할때 사용합니다.

A good supervisor creates a nice environment.
좋은 관리자는 훌륭한 환경을 만든다.

The moon goes round the earth.
과거에도 그렇고, 현재에도 그렇고, 미래에도 그럴것이라는것을 말하고 있습니다.

Korea has four seasons. 한국은 4계절이 있다.
(X) Korea had four seasons. 과거에는 그랬지만, 현재는 어떤지 모른다고 말하고 있습니다.
(X) Korea is having four seasons. 과거나 미래는 아니였는데 현재는 사계절을 가지고 있다고 말하고 있습니다.
   
2. 일상적인 습관, 현재의 상태나 동작을 말할때 현재형을 사용합니다.
I get up at 6 every morning.
나는 매일 아침 6시에 일어난다.
(나는 오늘 아침 6시에 일어났고, 미래에도 그럴것이라는 것을 암시하고 있습니다.)

I work at a bank.
나는 은행에서 일한다

Jane is my friend.
제인은 내 친구다.
(제인은 현재에도 내 친구고, 과거에도 내 친구였고, 미래에도 내 친구일것을 암시하고 있습니다.)

The company produces a family of household products.
그 회사는 가정용품을 생산한다.


3. 속담을 말할때 현재형을 사용합니다.

Empty vessels make the most sound.
빈수레가 요란하다.

4. 왕(go), 래(come), 발(start, leave), 착(arrive)을 나타내는 동사는 현재형을 사용합니다.

She goes back to Seoul tomrrow.
그녀는 내일 서울로 돌아간다.
(미래를 나타내는 부사와 함께 쓰였지만, 현재시제를 씁니다. 거의 100% 확실한 미래를 나타낼때.)

5. 시간과 조건을 나타내는 부사절에서는 현재시제을 사용합니다.

When your team finish the write-up, please have them send it to me.
당신 팀이 기사를 다쓰면, 그것을 나에게 보내라고 해주세요.
시간과 조건을 나타태는 부사절 : when, before, after, if, as soon as, unless, by the time













##################################################################################################
과거
과거동사
I lived in Seoul.
나는 서울에 살았습니다.
 
과거 시제에 숨어 있는 진짜 의미
I lived in Seoul.
과거에 서울에 살았지만, 현재에도 서울에 살고 있는지는 알 수가 없습니다.
영어에서 과거형이 가지는 단점
과거의 일을 현재와 연관시키지 못합니다. 그래서 현재완료형시제가 존재합니다.
과거와 현재 완료의 비교
I lived in Seoul. (과거에 서울에 살았지만, 현재에도 서울에 살고 있는지는 알 수가 없음)

I have lived in Seoul.  (지금까지도 서울에 살고 있음)

Summer came! (과거에 여름이였지만, 현재에도 여름인지 알수가 없습니다.)

Summer has came!. (지금도 여름인 상태. )

I lost my wallet. (나는 지갑을 잃어 버렸는데 지금은 그 지갑을 찾았는지 못찾았는지 알 수 없다.)

I have lost my wallet. (지갑을 잃어 버렸는데 지금까지도 못찾고 있음.)
과거형 동사를 만드는 세가지 방법
1.	규칙적으로 변함 : 동사의 원형 + ed
2.	불규칙적으로 변함1 : lie - lay
3.	불규칙적으로 변함1 : cut - cut




##################################################################################################
미래
will + 동사의 원형
I will buy a new car.
be going to + 동사의 원형 (계획된 미래)
I am going to buy a new car.
would + 동사의 원형 (약한 의지의 미래)
I would buy a new car.
미래시제의 의미
미래에 대한 계획이나 의지에 대해 이야기 합니다.
 
미래를 이야기하고 있는 4개의 시제
1. 현재형 : 현재형은 현재뿐만 아니라 과거나 미래에 대해서도 이야기 하고 있습니다.
The moon goes round the earth. 달은 현재뿐만 아니라 과거에도 그렇고, 미래에도 지구 주변을 돌고 있을겁니다.
2. will 미래형 : be going to보다는 조금 약한 의지나 계획에 대해 이야기 하고 있습니다.
3. be going to 미래형 : 확실한 계획이나 의지, 즉 계획된 미래를 말할때 사용합니다.
4. would 미래형 : will보다 약한 의지로 말할때 사용합니다.
미래를 이야기 하고 있는 4개 시제의 확신이나 의지의 정도
현재형은 100%의 확신이나 의지 - 95%의 의지 be going to - will(90%의 의지) - would(90% 이하)
o	I buy a new car tomorrow . 99.9% 확실
o	I am going to buy a new car tomorrow .  95% 확실
o	I will buy a new car tomorrow . 90% 확실
o	I would buy a new car tomorrow . will보다는 약한 의지
자연현상에 대한 미래형의 사용
날씨나 천재지변같은 자연현상은 계획할 수 있는게 아니기 때문에 be going to를 사용하지 못하고, will을 사용해야 합니다. 하지만 스피킹에서는 be going to를 사용하기도 하는데 예를 들어 It is going to rain이라고 하면 문을 열고 나가보기 거의 비가오기 직전의 날씨일때 이렇게 말하기도 합니다. 거의 100%비가올것이라고 예상될 때 사용할 수 있습니다.

현재 진행
be동사 + ~ing
I am reading a book.
현재진행형을 바라보는 시야
1. 지금 이 순간 별어지고 있는 일 : I am waking up now.
2. 일정한 주기를 가지고 반복과 멈춤, 시작이 반복되는 것.
o	오늘 하루동안 책을 읽다 안읽다를 반복 → I am reading a book today.
o	주중에 2~3일 정도 운동하기를 서너달정도 하고 있는 중 → I am exercising this month.
o	일년동안 우표 수집을 불규칙적으로 4번정도 해고 있는 중 → I am collecting stamps this year.
현재형과 현재진행형의 2가지 차이
1. 현재형은 과거, 현재, 미래를 모두 내포하고 있습니다.
He runs. 과거에도 뛰었고, 현재에도 뛰고, 미래에도 뛰겠다는 이야기.
2. 현재형보다 현재진행형이 좀 더 생동감 있습니다.
He is running → 현재형보다 좀 더 생동감 있다.
o	I go to school. 나는 학교에 다닌다. (학생이다)
I am going to school. 나는 (지금) 학교에 가고 있다.
o	What do you do? 보통 뭐해 (직업이 뭐야?)
What are you doing? (지금) 뭐하니?
미래를 이야기 하고 있는 5개의 시제
o	현재 진행 : I am buying a new car tomorrow. 100% 죽으면 귀신이 되어서라도 간다.
o	현재 : I buy a new car tomorrow. 99.9% 죽으면 못간다.
o	be going to 미래 : I am going to buy a new car tomorrow. 95%.
o	will 미래 : I will buy a new car tomorrow. 90%
o	would 미래 : I would buy a new car tomorrow.
진행형 안에서의 always
o	항상 always : You always call me at night.
o	맨날 always : You are always calling me at night.(일반적으로 진행형과 함께 쓰이면 부정적인 뉘앙스지만, 앞뒤 문맥에 따라 긍정적으로 들리기도 합니다.)
현재진행형으로 쓰면 어색한 동사
일반적으로 "변함없음"의 의미를 내포하고있는 동사는 진행형으로 쓰이지 않습니다.
o	I love you : 변함없이 사랑한다는 뜻.
I am loving you. 지금 당장은 사랑하지만, 과거나 미래에도 사랑할지 안할지 모른다는 의미
o	I have money : 보통 현재형으로 씁니다. 별일이 없는 이상 그 돈은 그냥 통장이나 주머니에 있을 돈.
I am having money. : 강조를 하고 있거나 지금 가지고 있는데 곧 쓸 돈일 경우에만 씁니다.
과거 진행

was/were + ~ing
I was having dinner.
과거 진행의 의미
현재 이전의 시간은 전부 과거이고, 과거 진행형은 과거 중 특별한 한 시점을 이야기 합니다.
과거형과 과거진행형의 2가지 차이
1.	과거형은 과거에 일어난 일을 의미하며 과거진행형은 과거 어느한 시점에 일어난 일을 이야기 하고 있습니다. 
2.	과거형보다 과거진행형이 좀 더 생동감 있습니다.
과거와 과거진행형이 함께 쓰였을 때
과거와 과거 진행형이 함께 쓰였을 때 과거진행형이 항상 먼저 일어난 일입니다.
o	When I entered the house, the phone was ringing. 전화가 울린것이 먼저 일어난 일.
o	While I was watching a video, she was reading a magazine by me. 두 사건이 동시에 일어남.

























##################################################################################################
미래 진행
will be ~ing
I will be leaving for Seoul.
be going to be ~ing
I am going to be leaving for Seoul.

단순미래와 미래진행형
미래진행형에서 특정한 시점이나 시간을 제시하지 않은 경우 미래진행형이나 단순미래형이나 같은 문법이다.
미래진행형의 종류 3가지
o	단순미래 : I will wait for your reply.
o	
o	미래진행일반 : I will be waiting for your reply. 단순 미래 대신 미래진행형을 사용했다면 강조되고, 좀 더 생동감있게 느껴진다.
o	
o	미래진행계획 : I am going to be waiting for your reply. 계획한 미래
미래형의 변동가능성
o	will wait : 변동가능성이 가장 큰 미래
o	
o	will be waiting : 변동가능성이 작은 미래
o	
o	be going to be waiting : 변동가능성이 거의 없는 미래

현재 완료 (*중요*)

have + p.p.
I have lived in seoul.
그들은 현재까지 그 시험을 위해서 준비했다.
현재완료의 해석
현재까지 ~했다.
o	I have finished my homework : 나는 (현재까지) 숙제를 끝냈다.
o	He has been to France : 그는 (현재까지) 프랑스에 가본적이 있다.
o	I have seen the movie : 나는 (현재까지) 그 영화를 본적이 있다..
o	I have lost my watch : 나는 (현재까지) 내 시계를 잃어버렸다.
have의 4가지 용도.
o	가지다, 먹다 : I have promise.
o	시키다 : I have my dog go outside.
o	~해야만 한다 (have to) : I have to know this.
o	현재까지 ~했다(현재분사) : I have prepared for the test.
종결, 끝냄, 완료를 나타냅니다.
have의 역할과 과거분사의 역할
have는 인칭변화를 하는 동사의 역할을 하며,
과거분사는 동사(have)의 구체적인 내용을 말해주고 있습니다. 여기 과거분사는 동사가 아니라 형용사입니다.
과거 분사를 쓰는 이유
현재분사는 진행의 뉘앙스를 가지고 있으며, 과거분사는 완료의 뉘앙스를 가지고 있습니다.
"현재까지 ~했다"는 완료의 뉘앙스를 가지고 있으므로 과거분사를 사용합니다.
현재완료의 의미
과거의 동작 + 현재의 의미 : 과거의 동작에 대해 말하고 있지만, 과거의 사건,동작으로 인해 현재 어떻다라는 말을 하려는 것임. (우리나라 말로 해석할때 과거의 형태로 해석되기 때문에 과거시제와 혼돈스러워함.)
o	I lost my watch (과거에 시계를 잃어버렸는데 지금 찾았는지 찾지 못했는지 알지 못함.)
o	I have lost my watch (과거에 시계를 잃어버렸는데 아직도 못찾아서 지금 시계가 없다는 뜻.)
과거와 현재완료의 비교
단순과거(점의 시제)
o	과거시점의 단순한 현실을 이야기. 현재 상황에 대해서는 아는 바 없음.
o	과거의 분명한 시점을 나타내는 단어들과 함께 온다.
three days ago, last year, last week, yesterday, in 1985, 
대화1
o	A : Did you have lunch?
o	B : Yes, I had lunch (or Yes, I did)
현재완료(선의 시제)
o	과거의 불특정 시점에서 시작된 상황이나 동작이 현재에 어떤 의미를 지니고 있는지에 대한 이야기
o	과거의 불분명한 시점을 나타내는 단어들과 함께 온다. (불분명한 시점들은 과거시제와도 어울린다.)
ever, never, already, yet, just, today, this week, this month, in my life
대화2 (단순과거로 대답하면 이상한 상황)
o	A : Are you hungry now?
o	B : No, I've just have lunch.
