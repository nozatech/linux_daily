현재완료에서 been은 어떨 때 쓰나요? been이 어떻게 사용 
되는지 여러 가지 예문을 통해 자세히 알려주세요. 

been은 말 그대로 be 동사가 현재완료의 have p.p.안에서 
쓰일 때 p.p.형으로 쓰인 겁니다. 자세히 알아볼까요? 


been은 말 그대로 be 동사가 현재완료의 have p.p. 안에서 쓰일 때, 
p.p.형으로 쓰인 겁니다. 그러므로 be 동사가 쓰이는 곳은 모두 쓰인다고 보면 되는 거죠. 

1) 현재완료진행으로 쓰일 때 

* She has been reading a book all day. (그녀는 하루 내내 책을 읽어왔다.) 
“~ 해오고 있다“ 라는 뜻을 나타내는 위와 같은 문장을, “현재완료진행시제”라고 합니다. 

일단 현재 완료 진행을 이해하기 위해서, 진행 시제에 대해서 알아 볼까요? 
여러분은! 진행 시제를 어떻게 쓰나요? 
그렇죠, be동사 + ing 의 형태입니다. 

* I am doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 하고 있습니다.) 
이런 것이 현재 진행 시제이죠. 여러분은! 현재 완료는 어떻게 쓰나요? 
그렇죠, have + p.p 의 형태입니다. 

그럼 현재완료 진행은 어떻게 쓸까요? 말 그대로, 현재완료 진행은 
현재완료 + 현재 진행 입니다. 
have + p.p + be동사 + ing = have + been(be동사의 p.p형태) + ~ing 입니다. 
뜻은 “~ 해 오고 있다” 로, 진행의 느낌이 있을 때 쓰는 거구요. 

그렇다면, 위의 문장으로, 현재완료진행 시제를 만들어 봅시다. 
* I am doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 하고 있습니다.) 
-> I have been doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 해 오고 있습니다.) 
어떤가요? 쉽지 않나요? ^-^ 

2) ~ 있다. 는 be 동사의 의미를 살려서 쓸 때 

현재완료는 be 동사에서도 똑같이 적용되어, is, are, am 등이 
have(has) + been 으로 바뀐다는 것을 알면 이해하기가 쉬울 거예요. 

예문으로 보면, 
* It has been very hot since last week. (지난 주부터 아주 더워왔다) 
이 문장을 보면, 간단히 현재완료시제의 문장 이예요. 
일단, “ 덥다 ” 라는 문장을 보면 It is hot. 이죠. 
현재완료 형태로 바꾸면 is 가 has been 이 되어서 It has been hot. 이 됩니다. 

※이와 관련해서, 날씨에 관한 현재완료 표현을 많이 질문 하시는데요, 
* It has been rainy since last Sunday. 
* It has rained since last Sunday. 
이 두 예문을 봅시다. 둘다 ‘저번 주 일요일 이후로 계속 비가 왔다’는 의미인데요. 
이 두 문장을 보고, “ been을 어디에는 붙이고 어디에는 안 붙이나요? “ 
하고 묻는 학생들이 있습니다. 

위 문장들에서는 been 을 붙이고 안 붙이고의 문제가 아니고, 
먼저 알아둬야 할 것은, “무엇이 동사인가” 하는 것 같네요. 

위의 첫 번째 문장을 봅시다. 
It has been rainy since last Sunday. (저번 주 일요일 이후로 계속 비가 오고 있다.) 
이 문장을 현재형으로 바꾸면 어떤 문장이 될까요? 
It is rainy. (비가 옵니다) 이지요? 
be 동사가 본동사인 문장이지요? 그렇기 때문에, is 가 has been 으로 변합니다. 

두 번째 문장을 보면, 
It has rained since last Sunday. (저번 주 일요일 이후로 비가 와 왔다.) 
이 문장의 현재형은 It rains. (비가 옵니다.) 이지요? 
rains 가 본동사 이므로, has rained 로 변형됩니다. 
동사가 be동사인 현재형 문장을 현재완료형으로 바꾸면, 
has(have) been 이 되는 거고, 동사가 일반 동사인 현재형 문장을 
현재완료형으로 바꾸면, have(has) + 일반 동사의 p.p 가 됩니다. 

3) “~에 갔다 오다”라는 뜻으로 쓸 때. be동사는 “~이다“ 
혹은 ”~있다“란 의미입니다. 

하지만, be 동사가 p.p. 형으로 쓰이면 go and come 
즉, “갔다 왔다“의 의미를 갖게 됩니다. 
왜 그런지 그 의미를 추측 해 봅시다. 

* I have been to New York. 이란 문장을 보면, 지금 내가 여기에서 
이야기 하고 있는데, “뉴욕에도 있었다.”란 문장을 썼으니, 
아~ 그렇다면, 뉴욕에 갔다고 온 것이군. 이란 의미가 되는 게 아닌가 싶습니다. 



"have been to"는 하나의 숙어처럼 
" ~에 갔다 왔다" 혹은 "~에 가본 적이 있다"란 말로 굳혀져서 사용하는 문구 입니다. 

하지만, be 동사가 p.p. 형 일 때만 
go and come 의 의미를 갖고, 
그냥 be동사는 ~이다, ~있다의 
의미만 갖습니다. 

그러므로 “ 나는 뉴욕에 갔다.“ 라고 
말하고 싶다면 be 동사가 아니라 
I went to New York. 이라고 말해야 합니다. 


마지막으로 been은 현재완료 수동태 문장을 만들 때도 사용됩니다. 

수동태는 be + p.p 형태를 취하므로 현재완료 수동태를 만들 때는 
be동사 역할을 하는 been이 와야 합니다. 

예를 들어, 
We have polluted water. 현재 완료 문장을 현재완료 수동태로 고치려고 한다면 
Water has been polluted by us. 의 형태가 될 수 있겠죠. 
현재완료 have p.p + 수동태 be p.p 가 합쳐져서 have been p.p의 형태가 되는 거죠.

현재
현재동사 (동사의 원형)
I get up at 6 every morning.
현재 시제의 진짜 의미
현재 시제라고해서 지금 일어나고 있는 상황을 꼭 이야기 하고 있는 것은 아닙니다.
이런 경우는 현재 진행형을 더 많이 사용하게 됩니다.
현재 시제는 과거에도 그렇고, 현재에도 그렇고, 미래에도 그럴것이라는 것을 말하고 있습니다.
현재 시제를 사용하는 5가지 상황
1. 일반적인 사실, 불변의 진리를 말할때 사용합니다.

A good supervisor creates a nice environment.
좋은 관리자는 훌륭한 환경을 만든다.

The moon goes round the earth.
과거에도 그렇고, 현재에도 그렇고, 미래에도 그럴것이라는것을 말하고 있습니다.

Korea has four seasons. 한국은 4계절이 있다.
(X) Korea had four seasons. 과거에는 그랬지만, 현재는 어떤지 모른다고 말하고 있습니다.
(X) Korea is having four seasons. 과거나 미래는 아니였는데 현재는 사계절을 가지고 있다고 말하고 있습니다.
   
2. 일상적인 습관, 현재의 상태나 동작을 말할때 현재형을 사용합니다.
I get up at 6 every morning.
나는 매일 아침 6시에 일어난다.
(나는 오늘 아침 6시에 일어났고, 미래에도 그럴것이라는 것을 암시하고 있습니다.)

I work at a bank.
나는 은행에서 일한다

Jane is my friend.
제인은 내 친구다.
(제인은 현재에도 내 친구고, 과거에도 내 친구였고, 미래에도 내 친구일것을 암시하고 있습니다.)

##
과거
과거동사
I lived in Seoul.
나는 서울에 살았습니다.
 
과거 시제에 숨어 있는 진짜 의미
I lived in Seoul.
과거에 서울에 살았지만, 현재에도 서울에 살고 있는지는 알 수가 없습니다.
영어에서 과거형이 가지는 단점
과거의 일을 현재와 연관시키지 못합니다. 그래서 현재완료형시제가 존재합니다.
과거와 현재 완료의 비교
I lived in Seoul. (과거에 서울에 살았지만, 현재에도 서울에 살고 있는지는 알 수가 없음)

I have lived in Seoul.  (지금까지도 서울에 살고 있음)

Summer came! (과거에 여름이였지만, 현재에도 여름인지 알수가 없습니다.)

Summer has came!. (지금도 여름인 상태. )

I lost my wallet. (나는 지갑을 잃어 버렸는데 지금은 그 지갑을 찾았는지 못찾았는지 알 수 없다.)

I have lost my wallet. (지갑을 잃어 버렸는데 지금까지도 못찾고 있음.)
과거형 동사를 만드는 세가지 방법
1.	규칙적으로 변함 : 동사의 원형 + ed
2.	불규칙적으로 변함1 : lie - lay
3.	불규칙적으로 변함1 : cut - cut




##
미래
will + 동사의 원형
I will buy a new car.
be going to + 동사의 원형 (계획된 미래)
I am going to buy a new car.
would + 동사의 원형 (약한 의지의 미래)
I would buy a new car.
미래시제의 의미
미래에 대한 계획이나 의지에 대해 이야기 합니다.
 
미래를 이야기하고 있는 4개의 시제
1. 현재형 : 현재형은 현재뿐만 아니라 과거나 미래에 대해서도 이야기 하고 있습니다.
The moon goes round the earth. 달은 현재뿐만 아니라 과거에도 그렇고, 미래에도 지구 주변을 돌고 있을겁니다.
2. will 미래형 : be going to보다는 조금 약한 의지나 계획에 대해 이야기 하고 있습니다.
3. be going to 미래형 : 확실한 계획이나 의지, 즉 계획된 미래를 말할때 사용합니다.
4. would 미래형 : will보다 약한 의지로 말할때 사용합니다.
미래를 이야기 하고 있는 4개 시제의 확신이나 의지의 정도
현재형은 100%의 확신이나 의지 - 95%의 의지 be going to - will(90%의 의지) - would(90% 이하)
o	I buy a new car tomorrow . 99.9% 확실
o	I am going to buy a new car tomorrow .  95% 확실
o	I will buy a new car tomorrow . 90% 확실
o	I would buy a new car tomorrow . will보다는 약한 의지
자연현상에 대한 미래형의 사용
날씨나 천재지변같은 자연현상은 계획할 수 있는게 아니기 때문에 be going to를 사용하지 못하고, will을 사용해야 합니다. 하지만 스피킹에서는 be going to를 사용하기도 하는데 예를 들어 It is going to rain이라고 하면 문을 열고 나가보기 거의 비가오기 직전의 날씨일때 이렇게 말하기도 합니다. 거의 100%비가올것이라고 예상될 때 사용할 수 있습니다.

##
현재 진행
be동사(am,is,are,be) + ~ing
I am reading a book.
현재진행형을 바라보는 시야
1. 지금 이 순간 별어지고 있는 일 : I am waking up now.
2. 일정한 주기를 가지고 반복과 멈춤, 시작이 반복되는 것.
o	오늘 하루동안 책을 읽다 안읽다를 반복 → I am reading a book today.
o	주중에 2~3일 정도 운동하기를 서너달정도 하고 있는 중 → I am exercising this month.
o	일년동안 우표 수집을 불규칙적으로 4번정도 해고 있는 중 → I am collecting stamps this year.
현재형과 현재진행형의 2가지 차이
1. 현재형은 과거, 현재, 미래를 모두 내포하고 있습니다.
He runs. 과거에도 뛰었고, 현재에도 뛰고, 미래에도 뛰겠다는 이야기.
2. 현재형보다 현재진행형이 좀 더 생동감 있습니다.
He is running → 현재형보다 좀 더 생동감 있다.
o	I go to school. 나는 학교에 다닌다. (학생이다)
I am going to school. 나는 (지금) 학교에 가고 있다.
o	What do you do? 보통 뭐해 (직업이 뭐야?)
What are you doing? (지금) 뭐하니?
미래를 이야기 하고 있는 5개의 시제
o	현재 진행 : I am buying a new car tomorrow. 100% 죽으면 귀신이 되어서라도 간다.
o	현재 : I buy a new car tomorrow. 99.9% 죽으면 못간다.
o	be going to 미래 : I am going to buy a new car tomorrow. 95%.
o	will 미래 : I will buy a new car tomorrow. 90%
o	would 미래 : I would buy a new car tomorrow.
진행형 안에서의 always
o	항상 always : You always call me at night.
o	맨날 always : You are always calling me at night.(일반적으로 진행형과 함께 쓰이면 부정적인 뉘앙스지만, 앞뒤 문맥에 따라 긍정적으로 들리기도 합니다.)
현재진행형으로 쓰면 어색한 동사
일반적으로 "변함없음"의 의미를 내포하고있는 동사는 진행형으로 쓰이지 않습니다.
o	I love you : 변함없이 사랑한다는 뜻.
I am loving you. 지금 당장은 사랑하지만, 과거나 미래에도 사랑할지 안할지 모른다는 의미
o	I have money : 보통 현재형으로 씁니다. 별일이 없는 이상 그 돈은 그냥 통장이나 주머니에 있을 돈.
I am having money. : 강조를 하고 있거나 지금 가지고 있는데 곧 쓸 돈일 경우에만 씁니다.
과거 진행

was/were + ~ing
I was having dinner.
과거 진행의 의미
현재 이전의 시간은 전부 과거이고, 과거 진행형은 과거 중 특별한 한 시점을 이야기 합니다.
과거형과 과거진행형의 2가지 차이
1.	과거형은 과거에 일어난 일을 의미하며 과거진행형은 과거 어느한 시점에 일어난 일을 이야기 하고 있습니다. 
2.	과거형보다 과거진행형이 좀 더 생동감 있습니다.
과거와 과거진행형이 함께 쓰였을 때
과거와 과거 진행형이 함께 쓰였을 때 과거진행형이 항상 먼저 일어난 일입니다.
o	When I entered the house, the phone was ringing. 전화가 울린것이 먼저 일어난 일.
o	While I was watching a video, she was reading a magazine by me. 두 사건이 동시에 일어남.

























##
미래 진행
will be ~ing
I will be leaving for Seoul.
be going to be ~ing
I am going to be leaving for Seoul.

단순미래와 미래진행형
미래진행형에서 특정한 시점이나 시간을 제시하지 않은 경우 미래진행형이나 단순미래형이나 같은 문법이다.
미래진행형의 종류 3가지
o	단순미래 : I will wait for your reply.
o	
o	미래진행일반 : I will be waiting for your reply. 단순 미래 대신 미래진행형을 사용했다면 강조되고, 좀 더 생동감있게 느껴진다.
o	
o	미래진행계획 : I am going to be waiting for your reply. 계획한 미래
미래형의 변동가능성
o	will wait : 변동가능성이 가장 큰 미래
o	
o	will be waiting : 변동가능성이 작은 미래
o	
o	be going to be waiting : 변동가능성이 거의 없는 미래

현재 완료 (*중요*)

have + p.p.
I have lived in seoul.
그들은 현재까지 그 시험을 위해서 준비했다.
현재완료의 해석
현재까지 ~했다.
o	I have finished my homework : 나는 (현재까지) 숙제를 끝냈다.
o	He has been to France : 그는 (현재까지) 프랑스에 가본적이 있다.
o	I have seen the movie : 나는 (현재까지) 그 영화를 본적이 있다..
o	I have lost my watch : 나는 (현재까지) 내 시계를 잃어버렸다.
have의 4가지 용도.
o	가지다, 먹다 : I have promise.
o	시키다 : I have my dog go outside.
o	~해야만 한다 (have to) : I have to know this.
o	현재까지 ~했다(현재분사) : I have prepared for the test.
종결, 끝냄, 완료를 나타냅니다.
have의 역할과 과거분사의 역할
have는 인칭변화를 하는 동사의 역할을 하며,
과거분사는 동사(have)의 구체적인 내용을 말해주고 있습니다. 여기 과거분사는 동사가 아니라 형용사입니다.
과거 분사를 쓰는 이유
현재분사는 진행의 뉘앙스를 가지고 있으며, 과거분사는 완료의 뉘앙스를 가지고 있습니다.
"현재까지 ~했다"는 완료의 뉘앙스를 가지고 있으므로 과거분사를 사용합니다.
현재완료의 의미
과거의 동작 + 현재의 의미 : 과거의 동작에 대해 말하고 있지만, 과거의 사건,동작으로 인해 현재 어떻다라는 말을 하려는 것임. (우리나라 말로 해석할때 과거의 형태로 해석되기 때문에 과거시제와 혼돈스러워함.)
o	I lost my watch (과거에 시계를 잃어버렸는데 지금 찾았는지 찾지 못했는지 알지 못함.)
o	I have lost my watch (과거에 시계를 잃어버렸는데 아직도 못찾아서 지금 시계가 없다는 뜻.)
과거와 현재완료의 비교
단순과거(점의 시제)
o	과거시점의 단순한 현실을 이야기. 현재 상황에 대해서는 아는 바 없음.
o	과거의 분명한 시점을 나타내는 단어들과 함께 온다.
three days ago, last year, last week, yesterday, in 1985, 
대화1
o	A : Did you have lunch?
o	B : Yes, I had lunch (or Yes, I did)
현재완료(선의 시제)
o	과거의 불특정 시점에서 시작된 상황이나 동작이 현재에 어떤 의미를 지니고 있는지에 대한 이야기
o	과거의 불분명한 시점을 나타내는 단어들과 함께 온다. (불분명한 시점들은 과거시제와도 어울린다.)
ever, never, already, yet, just, today, this week, this month, in my life
대화2 (단순과거로 대답하면 이상한 상황)
o	A : Are you hungry now?
o	B : No, I've just have lunch.

40 Useful Words and Phrases for Top-Notch Essays
https://www.oxford-royale.co.uk/articles/words-phrases-good-essays.html

To be truly brilliant, an essay needs to utilise the right language. You could make a great point, but if it’s not intelligently articulated, you almost needn’t have bothered. Developing the language skills to build an argument and to write persuasively is crucial if you’re to write outstanding essays every time. In this article, we’re going to equip you with the words and phrases you need to write a top-notch essay, along with examples of how to utilise them. It’s by no means an exhaustive list, and there will often be other ways of using the words and phrases we describe that we won’t have room to include, but there should be more than enough below to help you make an instant improvement to your essay-writing skills – whether you’re a native English speaker or taking your first steps into writing essays in English.

General explaining
Let’s start by looking at language for general explanations of complex points.

1. In order to
Usage: “In order to” can be used to introduce an explanation for the purpose of an argument.

Example: “In order to understand X, we need first to understand Y.”

2. In other words
Usage: Use “in other words” when you want to express something in a different way (more simply), to make it easier to understand, or to emphasise or expand on a point.

Example: “Frogs are amphibians. In other words, they live on the land and in the water.”

3. To put it another way
Usage: This phrase is another way of saying “in other words”, and can be used in particularly complex points, when you feel that an alternative way of wording a problem may help the reader achieve a better understanding of its significance.

Example: “Plants rely on photosynthesis. To put it another way, they will die without the sun.”

4. That is to say
Usage: “That is” and “that is to say” can be used to add further detail to your explanation, or to be more precise.

Example: “Whales are mammals. That is to say, they must breathe air.”

5. To that end
Usage: Use “to that end” or “to this end” in a similar way to “in order to” or “so”.

Example: “Zoologists have long sought to understand how animals communicate with each other. To that end, a new study has been launched that looks at elephant sounds and their possible meanings.”

 

Graphs and phone.

 

Adding additional information to support a point
Students often make the mistake of using synonyms of “and” each time they want to add further information in support of a point they’re making, or to build an argument. Here are some cleverer ways of doing this.

6. Moreover
Usage: Employ “moreover” at the start of a sentence to add extra information in support of a point you’re making.

Example: “Moreover, the results of a recent piece of research provide compelling evidence in support of…”

7. Furthermore
Usage:This is also generally used at the start of a sentence, to add extra information.

Example: “Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that…”

8. What’s more
Usage: This is used in the same way as “moreover” and “furthermore”.

Example: “What’s more, this isn’t the only evidence that supports this hypothesis.”

9. Likewise
Usage: Use “likewise” when you want to talk about something that agrees with what you’ve just mentioned.

Example: “Scholar A believes X. Likewise, Scholar B argues compellingly in favour of this point of view.”

10. Similarly
Usage: Use “similarly” in the same way as “likewise”.

Example: “Audiences at the time reacted with shock to Beethoven’s new work, because it was very different to what they were used to. Similarly, we have a tendency to react with surprise to the unfamiliar.”

11. Another key thing to remember
Usage: Use the phrase “another key point to remember” or “another key fact to remember” to introduce additional facts without using the word “also”.

Example: “As a Romantic, Blake was a proponent of a closer relationship between humans and nature. Another key point to remember is that Blake was writing during the Industrial Revolution, which had a major impact on the world around him.”

12. As well as
Usage: Use “as well as” instead of “also” or “and”.

Example: “Scholar A argued that this was due to X, as well as Y.”

13. Not only… but also
Usage: This wording is used to add an extra piece of information, often something that’s in some way more surprising or unexpected than the first piece of information.

Example: “Not only did Edmund Hillary have the honour of being the first to reach the summit of Everest, but he was also appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.”

14. Coupled with
Usage: Used when considering two or more arguments at a time.

Example: “Coupled with the literary evidence, the statistics paint a compelling view of…”

15. Firstly, secondly, thirdly…
Usage: This can be used to structure an argument, presenting facts clearly one after the other.

Example: “There are many points in support of this view. Firstly, X. Secondly, Y. And thirdly, Z.

16. Not to mention/to say nothing of
Usage: “Not to mention” and “to say nothing of” can be used to add extra information with a bit of emphasis.

Example: “The war caused unprecedented suffering to millions of people, not to mention its impact on the country’s economy.”

Fountain pen and flower.

 

Words and phrases for demonstrating contrast
When you’re developing an argument, you will often need to present contrasting or opposing opinions or evidence – “it could show this, but it could also show this”, or “X says this, but Y disagrees”. This section covers words you can use instead of the “but” in these examples, to make your writing sound more intelligent and interesting.

17. However
Usage: Use “however” to introduce a point that disagrees with what you’ve just said.

Example: “Scholar A thinks this. However, Scholar B reached a different conclusion.”

18. On the other hand
Usage: Usage of this phrase includes introducing a contrasting interpretation of the same piece of evidence, a different piece of evidence that suggests something else, or an opposing opinion.

Example: “The historical evidence appears to suggest a clear-cut situation. On the other hand, the archaeological evidence presents a somewhat less straightforward picture of what happened that day.”

19. Having said that
Usage: Used in a similar manner to “on the other hand” or “but”.

Example: “The historians are unanimous in telling us X, an agreement that suggests that this version of events must be an accurate account. Having said that, the archaeology tells a different story.”

20. By contrast/in comparison
Usage: Use “by contrast” or “in comparison” when you’re comparing and contrasting pieces of evidence.

Example: “Scholar A’s opinion, then, is based on insufficient evidence. By contrast, Scholar B’s opinion seems more plausible.”

21. Then again
Usage: Use this to cast doubt on an assertion.

Example: “Writer A asserts that this was the reason for what happened. Then again, it’s possible that he was being paid to say this.”

22. That said
Usage: This is used in the same way as “then again”.

Example: “The evidence ostensibly appears to point to this conclusion. That said, much of the evidence is unreliable at best.”

23. Yet
Usage: Use this when you want to introduce a contrasting idea.

Example: “Much of scholarship has focused on this evidence. Yet not everyone agrees that this is the most important aspect of the situation.”

Adding a proviso or acknowledging reservations
Sometimes, you may need to acknowledge a shortfalling in a piece of evidence, or add a proviso. Here are some ways of doing so.

24. Despite this
Usage: Use “despite this” or “in spite of this” when you want to outline a point that stands regardless of a shortfalling in the evidence.

Example: “The sample size was small, but the results were important despite this.”

25. With this in mind
Usage: Use this when you want your reader to consider a point in the knowledge of something else.

Example: “We’ve seen that the methods used in the 19th century study did not always live up to the rigorous standards expected in scientific research today, which makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions. With this in mind, let’s look at a more recent study to see how the results compare.”

26. Provided that
Usage: This means “on condition that”. You can also say “providing that” or just “providing” to mean the same thing.

Example: “We may use this as evidence to support our argument, provided that we bear in mind the limitations of the methods used to obtain it.”

27. In view of/in light of
Usage: These phrases are used when something has shed light on something else.

Example: “In light of the evidence from the 2013 study, we have a better understanding of…”

28. Nonetheless
Usage: This is similar to “despite this”.

Example: “The study had its limitations, but it was nonetheless groundbreaking for its day.”

29. Nevertheless
Usage: This is the same as “nonetheless”.

Example: “The study was flawed, but it was important nevertheless.”

30. Notwithstanding
Usage: This is another way of saying “nonetheless”.

Example: “Notwithstanding the limitations of the methodology used, it was an important study in the development of how we view the workings of the human mind.”

 

# Giving examples
Good essays always back up points with examples, but it’s going to get boring if you use the expression “for example” every time. Here are a couple of other ways of saying the same thing.

31. For instance
Example: “Some birds migrate to avoid harsher winter climates. Swallows, for instance, leave the UK in early winter and fly south…”

32. To give an illustration
Example: “To give an illustration of what I mean, let’s look at the case of…”

  

# Signifying importance
When you want to demonstrate that a point is particularly important, there are several ways of highlighting it as such.

33. Significantly
Usage: Used to introduce a point that is loaded with meaning that might not be immediately apparent.

Example: “Significantly, Tacitus omits to tell us the kind of gossip prevalent in Suetonius’ accounts of the same period.”

34. Notably
Usage: This can be used to mean “significantly” (as above), and it can also be 
used interchangeably with “in particular” (the example below demonstrates 
the first of these ways of using it).

Example: “Actual figures are notably absent from Scholar A’s analysis.”

35. Importantly
Usage: Use “importantly” interchangeably with “significantly”.

Example: “Importantly, Scholar A was being employed by X when he wrote this work, 
		and was presumably therefore under pressure to portray the situation more 
		favourably than he perhaps might otherwise have done.”


## Summarising
You’ve almost made it to the end of the essay, but your work isn’t over yet. 
You need to end by wrapping up everything you’ve talked about, showing that you’ve 
considered the arguments on both sides and reached the most likely conclusion. 
Here are some words and phrases to help you.

36. In conclusion
Usage: Typically used to introduce the concluding paragraph or sentence of an essay, 
		summarising what you’ve discussed in a broad overview.

Example: “In conclusion, the evidence points almost exclusively to Argument A.”

37. Above all
Usage: Used to signify what you believe to be the most significant point, 
		and the main takeaway from the essay.

Example: “Above all, it seems pertinent to remember that…”

38. Persuasive
Usage: This is a useful word to use when summarising which argument you find most convincing.
Example: “Scholar A’s point – that Constanze Mozart was motivated by financial gain – 
seems to me to be the most persuasive argument for her actions following Mozart’s death.”

39. Compelling
Usage: Use in the same way as “persuasive” above.
Example: “The most compelling argument is presented by Scholar A.”

40. All things considered
Usage: This means “taking everything into account”. 
Example: “All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume that…”

## Prefixes and Suffixes
In English we can add prefixes and suffixes to a basic word (known as the root word) in order to make a different word.

A PREFIX goes at the beginning of the word and changes its meaning, quite often to the complete opposite.
For example: Happy – Unhappy.

Here is a list of the most commonly used PREFIXES in the English language. 

PREFIX	  		MEANING			EXAMPLE WORD	NEW WORD
ad				adding			verb			adverb
ante			before			Room			Anteroom
anti			against			Freeze			Anti-freeze
auto			does by itself	Mobile			Automobile
cyber			computing		Space			Cyberspace
de				reverse			Frost			De-frost
dis-* 			not,opposite of agree			disagree
e				electronic		Mail			Email
em				cause to 		brace 			embrace
en-, 			cause to 		code			encode, embrace
ex				out / away from	Communicate		Ex-communicate
fore- 			before 			cast			forecast
im/in/il/ir		opposite	Possible / Correct	Impossible / Incorrect
inter			between			Act				Interact
mid				middle			Day				Midday
mis				do wrongly		Conduct			Misconduct
multi			many			Cultural		Multicultural
non				not				Sense			Nonsense
over			too much		Paid			Overpaid
pre				before			School			Pre-school
pro				go forward		Active			Pro-active
re				again			Do				Re-do
semi			half			Detached		Semi-detached
sub				under			Marine			Submarine
super			bigger than		Market			Supermarket
trans			across			Atlantic		Transatlantic
un				opposite		Happy			Unhappy
under			under			sea				undersea


A SUFFIX is added to the end of a word and changes it from one part of speech to another.
For example: Differ – Difference. The verb ‘Differ’ becomes a noun as 'Difference.'
When a SUFFIX is added to the end of a word it changes the word from one class (part of speech) to another.
For example: Like – Like-able. The verb ‘Like’ becomes an adjective as 'Liable.'

## Example email-1
Hi Team,
Last Friday, a team of over 20 individuals across different departments from BNEA volunteered 
our physical strength, keen sense of sight, touch, smell, along with our time to sort fresh 
peaches at the local Second Harvest Food Bank located on First Street. For those who have never 
sorted bins and bins of peaches; you really need to use your sense of sight to see if there’s 
any mold on the fruit, your sense of touch to see if any have gone mushy, and your sense of 
smell to pick out the fruit that may have turned. 
During the two hours we were there, the BNEA team sorted and boxed 241 cases of fruit 
(25-lbs per case) this equates to over 6000lbs of fresh peaches packaged up and made 
ready for distribution to smaller food banks that directly distribute food to the needy! 
I’m also proud to share that we were able to beat the Netflix team as they were only able 
to sort and package 3600lbs/144 cases of tomatoes😊.
I want to send my heartfelt thanks to the BNEA team members who came out to help those 
in need within our community. There will be another opportunity to help those in need 
as we approach the holiday season; stay tuned!

I used to play with my grandfather. Pull up a chair.(have a seat) 
A lot of good it does me with your mother-in-law following you around all the time. 
시어머니가 항상 지켜보는데 어떻건 무슨 상관이에요 
But I believe that ship has sailed. - No! It hasn't. 
Everyone's entitled to their opinion. 
So all in favor of the woodsman going medieval on the big bad wolf's ass.

Seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves. Shall I pull up a chair?

I think you're tired - (50/50 chance)in fact, you may not be tired but this thought has entered my brain. 
I believe you're tired - I'm pretty sure.

All that muscle and sinew(힘줄) pressed against my body. 
Well. Crisis averted(prevent, avoid). "Phew" 
I'll help for as long as I can but I have a lot on my plate tonight.

That night, while most of Wisteria Lane dreamt the night away, 
dance the ngith wasy <= to spend the whole night dancing
It wasn't until noon that Lynette finally took a break
	and the reality of what she had done began to sink in.
She had to repeat her words several times before they finally sank in(to become completely understood).
Don't be mad. I just didn't want you slipping into old habits. 
Juanita was now more convinced than ever that her treacherous(딴 마음을 먹은) 
	daughter-in-law was having an affair. 
Let's take what outside? - Your sorry ass. We're throwing down(to fight).

(말할 것도 없이) 물론 내 친구들은 문제 해결을 위해 발벗고 나섰다 
Wow, That's quite a pitching arm you got there. 
던지는 힘이 대단하다
I hope whoever hit Juanita gets put away for life.

S1-Episode 9
Her most recent great idea was born out of her boredom with her new life. 
That's how she came to start an affair with her tenage gardener, 
which was cut short(단축된) by a tragic accident. 
I go pick up the boys, we hit the park, and that should give you a good couple of hours. 
Of course he feels bad. He's just keeping up a facade.

- Finally got the charity bug? - You sound surprised.
	Charity bug <-someone who is enthusiastic about something
Wanna tell me why you had your foot in John Rowland's crotch(가랑이) yesterday?

Bree had given Lynette the low-down on Valley View Park. 
브리가 알려준 비밀장소는 벨리 뷰 공원이었다. Passive voice 
It was a gathering place for upscale nannies and their young charges(person or child). 
We're not gonna screw up Andrew's future because he sparked a doobie(joint). 
그깟 마리화나 좀 피웠다고 애 장래를 망치겠다는거야? 
Doesn't she, Edie? - Ah... It's a bit much. 
안 그래요, 이디? - 뭐 그런 대로 
She can be tough, but it comes with the territory, right? 
하지만 다른 집에 가도 더 나은 거 없어요 
As she rummaged(샅샅이 뒤지다) through Andrew's private possessions, 
it occurred to her that sometimes a little betrayal is good for the soul.  
Helen: Oh, Gabrielle, I didn't get a chance to tell you how sorry I was about what 
happened at the fundraiser. I didn't intend to cause a scene. People didn't even notice. 
아, 가브리엘, 자선 패션쇼에서 있었던 일에 대해서 사과도 하지 못했었네. 그럴려고 했던건 아니야.
No, you're wrong. It's not even close to being over. 
틀렸어. 아직 끝나려면 아직 멀었어. 
If you know anything about Zach's whereabouts(행방), you need to tell me now.

우리 내면의 어둠을 몰아낼 유일한 방법은 동정심이란 불을 밝히는 것이다 
well, they were spent in the company of men. 
남자들의 방문이 이어진다 
And I find that absolutely exhilarating. 
아주 기분 좋은 일이죠 
She waved it off like it was nothing, but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of... pity
그 친군 아무 말 않고 가버렸어요 하지만 그 눈엔... 동정심이 어려있었죠 
Oh, would you be a lamb and go out the back? 
Every morality play has its cast of characters. 
모든 심판에는 중요 등장 인물들이 있다 
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded(구류). What's next? 
Did you tell her you have a wife or does that hinder your pick up style? 
너는 아내가 있다고 말 했니? 아니면 너의 스타일에 방해가 되는가?

Trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be. 
그렇게 좋은 것만은 아니에요
Muntz was a hard-ass. No mercy.
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian that when my mom made parole, 
I was actually happy to see her. 
huh, Lesser of two evils. 
그래도 엄마가 둘 중엔 그래도 나았으니까요 
	something that is bad, but not as bad as something else:
	I had the choice of going with my parents to a concert or staying at my grumpy 
	aunt's house – I chose my aunt's house as the lesser of two evils.

I cover the veggies with some cheese. - Ooh. You sly dog. 	
 치즈 속에 숨기면 되죠? - 역시 영리해

Within five minutes Mrs. Huber managed to disparage what Edie was wearing. 
후버 부인은 단 5분만에 이디의 옷차림을 헐뜯기 시작했다 
Yes, Martha Huber could be cruel, offensive and downright mean. 
한마디로 마사 후버는 모지고,모욕적이고,노골적인 심술궂은 사람이었다 
I hated Martha. She was a wretched pig of a woman. 
난 언니가 싫어요 비열하기 짝이없는 인간이죠 
We need to jump on this. Time is of the essence. 
I lay awake at night thinking about it.

Why don't you hock some of your jewelry?
보석을 팔지 그래요? 
you don't say! You said it. 아, 그래!
That makes two of us. (나도 그래)
Just so you know, I really am grateful for everything you're doing for me. 
날 위해서 이렇게 해주는거 다 정말 고맙게 생각해 
You're here because your children are master extortionists(협박범). 
It's a romantic date with a single man. I intend to French the hell out of him. 
 키스하고 싶은 멋진 남자! 
Basically, we both got plastered on eggnog and we found ourselves standing under the mistletoe
and we were like, "OK, so what do we do now?"

I can't believe Edie brought the whole thing up.

And just so you know, I'm... sorry for flipping out. 
너무 감정적으로 행동한 거 사과할게 

S1-Episode 12

Oh, jeez. Didn't take the media long to get wind of this. 
이런, 어느새 미이가가 냄새맡고 달려들 오는군 
How's that for exciting? 
신나지 않아요? 
Don't expect to see this guy for a few months. I'm gonna be riding him hard. 
Well, if anybody can go the distance, he can. I should know. 
We are around the clock.			<- continuing
lugging a baby						<-  to carry laboriously
Telling me to plan ahead is like telling me to sprout wings. 
더 일찍 서두르라니 그건 오지말란 얘기예요 
And things like being told to plan ahead make me so crazy 
It's a vicious cycle(악순환). See how that works? 
And I would rather cut off my hand than hurt his feelings. 
그래도 어떻게 모른 척 하겠어요 
Pretending to care, when all they want are the sordid(filthy|dirty) details. 
Well, we might as well give the people what they want. 
그럼 원하는 것를 조금 줄까요? 
Hello. I want to thank you all for coming out here and expressing your genuine sorrow and disbelief. 
Oh, in lieu of a memorial service, 
오, 추도식 대신에,
I know. So I thought that some of the neighbors could caravan up there. 
	caravan <-A company of travelers journeying together, as across a desert or through hostile territory.
I have a gig(job) tomorrow. I can't leave 'em hanging. 
Please. It's great dirt. I even put it in my journal. 
그런 엄청난 얘기를? 나라도 일기에 쓰겠다 
That's why you're going to grovel at her feet and beg forgiveness. 
완전히 납작 엎드려서 싹싹 용서를 빌어 
That's right. You're gonna have to suck up to Edie Britt. 
죽는 시늉이라도 해야지 어쩌겠어? 
Just kinda snuck up on us.
I gotta say, I envy you.
In the name of God, why? 
무슨 속셈이야? 
Spit it out already. I'm busy. 
Who's gonna change diapers when you're pumping iron(Lifting freeweights) in a federal prison? Huh? 
be caught off guard
허를 찔리다
I'm still the outsider that doesn't get invited to the cool parties, 
and you're still the perky cheerleader 
who thinks that she can pull the wool over everyone's eyes.  
난 아직도 이웃집 파티에 초대받지 못하는 이방인이고 
자긴 아직도 사람들 시선을 받는  멋진 치어리더거든 
Have a seat. Take a load off
	<- to sit down and/or relax
And just like that, Lynette realized the road to enlightenment(깨달음)
and spiritual well-being was now closed to her. 
You stepped up when nobody else would, and here I am thinking you have an ulterior motive(속셈). 
You just have to know that I am so racked with guilt, 
I don't think it's possible for me to suffer any more than I am already. 
내가 얼마나 죄책감을 느끼는지 그것만 알아주면 좋겠어 
어떤 처벌을 받는다고 해도 지금보다는 덜 괴로울 꺼야.


S1-Episode 13

It was easy for Susan to feel smug(자랑) with a daughter like Julie. 
She was bright, affectionate(다정한) and considerate(사려깊은) of others. 
John and I made a clean break.(끝냈다)
You can do this. Scooch(쭈그리다) down a few inches and I'll grab ya. 
I might strangle you for climbing up here in the first place. 
 Is Parker back up on the roof? - Yep. 파커가 지붕에 올라갔어?
I mean, if somehow we could level the playing field, then, um, 
maybe I could find a way to come back. 
누구도 손해본 것 없이 공평해지면 그땐 용서할 방법이 생길지도 모르죠 
	level the playing field <- 공평한 경쟁의 장을 만들다
OK. Uh, so who are we talking about here? Your dopey(멍청한) pharmacist? 	
The coffee's just dreadful(엄청 맛없는). 
If I could get a good person to love me, I would find a way to forgive them.
날 사랑하는 좋은 사람이라면 용서할 방법을 찾아야죠 
Well, you can wipe that disgusting smirk(능글맞은웃움) off your face. 
I just expected a bigger reaction. I've got knots in my stomach. 
난 당신이 충격 받을까봐 얼마나 걱정을 했는데 
I can't believe you're just uprooting us like this. 
왜 이사까지 가야하는지 전 모르겠어요 
Nice and taut, like this. 
이렇게 팽팽하게 매야지 
If you ever do get a vibe from Bree that she's interested in more than just friendship,  
I'd be careful if I were you. 
만약에 그 사람이 우정 이상의 관계에 관심을 보여도 
I just want you to know that she'd only be using you to even the score with me. 
나한테 복수하려고 조지를 이용하는 거란 얘기죠 

Was he now? Did he now?  <- "Really?" or "Indeed?
"Did he now?" could be substituted with "Really?" or "Indeed?" here. Person B is not 
really asking about anything, just expressing their surprise and dissatisfaction with 
the fact that person A was told that person B and person C ("he") did not speak for 2 years.
Dana is very much alive. 
데이나는 살아있다 
You didn't want me running my mouth. - That's not what it's about. 
함부로 말할까봐 두려워서요? - 그런 거 아냐 
Oh, whatever. Let's not beat a dead horse. 
알았으니까. 그만 얘기하자 
OK. Get it off your chest. 
괜찮아, 아음에 둔말 얘기해 
And that worries me because if confine in  you that can condone(눈감아주다) something like that, 
then what's gonna happen when you've been on the road for 40 years? 
그런 걸 전혀 아무렇지 않게 생각하는데 당신도 똑같은 짓을 할지 그걸 어떻게 알아? 
I'm so sorry about the ruckus(야단법석) I caused. 

A gesture that was met with measured enthusiasm. 
생각보다 거셌다 
	

S1-Episode 14
Well, this is the nicest present you boys have ever given me. 
I'll put it out on the front porch so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it. 
Lynette would cherish the memory of that moment for the rest of her life. 	
others managed to forget about the day entirely... again. 
그리고 어떤 사람은 이번에도 역시 잊고 	
It must have been an accident.
사고였을 거야
I, uh... had a standing order with the florist. 
꽃집에 미리 오더 해놓고 
Well, I could be mistaken. As I said, it's been years. 

I could have been a millionaire if I had accepted the deal last year. 
	<- But unfortunately I did not accept the deal and I can not be a millionaire now.
You could be a millionaire if you accept the deal NOW. 
	<- There is a chance for you to accept the deal and become a millionaire.	
I left the boat show because that coordinator was making passes at me. 	
	to make a pass at <- To flirt with someone.
Carlos and I are up to our asses in bills and we can't pay 'em. 	
Anything to get you back on your knees scrubbing where you belong. 	
	저러니 매일 저런 일이나 하면서 살지 
That place is so pretentious. I've been dying to go there. 	
	얼마나 문턱이 높은덴지 꼭 한번 가보고 싶었어요 
Boys? Get your little fannies(buttocks) inside. 	
	애들아 들어와.
she's gonna implode. 	impolode <- To collapse in on ones self,
Guys! Hey, my hands are tied. Thieves get spanked. 
	my hands are tied <- because the law requires a harsh sentence 
Is that the healthiest way to achieve a reconciliation? 
그게 화해를 위해서 바람직한 방법일까요? 
There'll be a lot of forced smiles and perfunctory(마지못해) love-making
but after a few decades whiz by(pass quickly), I'm sure I'll find a way to forgive him. 
He was terrified I'd figure it out. 
"I'm ready to procreate(아이를 만들어 내다), point me to the nearest cervix(자궁 경관)". 
Susan shouldn't have been so worried. 
사실 수잔은 그렇게 걱정할 필요가 없었다 
it was Lynette who decided to deliver the opening salvo(일제 사격). 
먼저 발포를 시작한 건 리네트였다 

Yes, the war of Wisteria Lane would indeed prove to be messy for everyone involved. 
Look what I found stashed in the boys' playhouse. 
Finding ways of getting along instead of, you know, hurling(fling) an egg at them. 
잘 지내도 시원치 않은데 당신은 계란을 던졌어 
the "pleasant human being" argument doesn't fly with you, we'll try self-preservation. 
좋아, 이런거 저런거 다 생각하지 말고 우릴 위해서라고 생각해봐
OK, my point is, the day will come when we need her help. 
And I don't want her not to help us just because of some silly feud(불화싸움). 
We'll be constructing simple scenarios and acting them out. 
간단한 시나리오를 만들어서 그대로 연기하면 되는 거야 
Well, the police are on their way to talk to him. Let them sort it out. 
Pretty lame, huh?  바보같죠? 
All we know is that Lynette's kids turned up with it. 
아이들이 거기서 찾았다고 말한 것 밖에 더 있어? 
Well, I wouldn't put it past them. 
그럴 가능성도 충분해 
That is about as likely as Mike having done it. 
마이크가 죽였다고 말할 수는 없다는 거지 
You may be able to abdicate all your parental responsibility, 
당신은 부모로서의 책임을 포기할 수 있을지 몰라도 
If that's the type he is, then good riddance. 	
	그런 애라면 잘 헤어진 거야 
Duggan is showing some of that glory-hounding, 	ass-kissing hustle that he is so well-known for. 
일부러 천천히 뛰면서 승리를 과시하는 꼴이라니 	
I forgot how much fun you are when you're bitter. 	
당신이 남헐뜯을 때 얼마나 재미있는지 모르지? 	
No, I'm sure he's just grandstanding.사람의 눈길을 끌어 인기를 노리는 행위 
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced. Do you have a moment? 
말도없이 와서 미안해.
It's not all coming up roses. <-everything isn't turning out okay
That was risky in retrospect(돌이켜보면). But you know what? still he gave me the job. 
조금 위험하긴 했지만 어쨌든 그 자리를 나한테 줬어 
I did! You told me to stop being a shrinking violet(부끄럼을 잘 타는 사람). 
Oh, are you going steady? 
그 애하고는 잘 돼? 
Decided to indulge(과식하는것) your sweet tooth(단것을 좋아하기)? - I'll be dead inside(~안에) a year. 
단 거 너무 드시는 거 아니에요? - 죽을 날이 1년도 안 남았어 
Martha Huber. Local busybody(참견하기 좋아하는 사람). I thought her murder was random. 
Maybe, but I won't be much good to you locked up. 
하지만 철창에 갇혀선 꼼짝할 수가 없습니다 
I'm rich, Mike. One of the best things about being rich 
is the security of knowing you can buy your way out of any problem. 
문제를 해결하는 길을 돈으로 살 수 있다는 거지 
till after, um, bedtime, and so we decided to pop in and visit the new V.P. 
새 사무실도 구경할 겸 데리고 나왔어 
Checking out the new executive digs? 새 사무실 구경하러 왔어요? 
Do you know how that came about? - He dropped his gun, cleaning it. 
이유는 아십니까?
It went just peachy. <-feeling fine. doing fine.
아주 훌륭했어요 
You might as well stay under there and never come up for air, 
'cause when you do, I'm gonna choke the living daylights out of you! 
나오는 날엔 내 손에 죽을 테니까! 
It's time for us to face the music.  <- 자기 행동의 결과를 깨끗이 받아들이다
For years he's been selfish and irresponsible, and now he's got to face the music.
And once we're back on our feet, we'll get a house as big as this one. 
	back on our feet <- well or successful again after being sick or having problems
The tables were turned. 뒤바뀐 상황 



S1-Episode 16
Mistresses(애인,정부) were confronted.

And once in great while, there comes a scandal so deliciously sordid(지저분한), 
its roar drowns out all other noise. 다른 소음들을 모두 잠재워 버리기도 한다 
There's not a lot of sleeping going on. Not if I'm doing my job right. 
남자들이 많다는 건 제가 유능하다는 얘기죠 
Maisy Gibbons, you're under arrest for solicitation((창녀의) 손님 유인). 
This is entrapment(함정). You all are making a gigantic mistake. 	
Yes, the scandalous arrest of Maisy Gibbons would soon prove to be the 'shot heard round the world.'
온 세상으로 전파되기 직전의 모습이었다.   
'shot heard round the world' <- The whole world heard about it and 
								it made everyone react in one way or another.
Innocent until proven guilty
I got dirt on Maisy Gibbons. 
메이지 기븐스에 관한 따끈한 소식이 있거든
Mike and I were just a fling. <- A brief period of indulging one's impulses.
Not even a full fling. Sort of a borderline fling. 
하긴 뭐 끝나고 말고 그럴 것도 없지만 
We'll get all the boys together once Topher's back on his feet. 
토퍼 다 나으면 다시 하면 되죠 뭐 
No. I try to steer clear of Utah. It's a little too conservative for me. 
	steer clear of <- to stay away from purposely
Gabrielle was now forced to improvise when it came to her personal hygiene, 
wherever and whenever she had the opportunity. 
위생적인 문제를 밖에서 해결하지 않을 수 없었다 
Guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves for reveling(야단 법석하다) in that woman's misery. 
다른사람 불행을 즐기는 건 부끄러운 일이야 
That being said, Edie, please continue. 
거기까지 말했어 이디, 계속해
Apparently, she has some high-profile johns and the DA's looking for a second term. 
메이지는 손님명단을 가지고 있고 검사는 바로 그 명단에 욕심을 내는거지 
So, the upshot is, Maisy is going to turn over her little black book with all of her clients' names
그래서 결국 메이지가 손님명단을 넘기기로 했나 
Can you imagine the fallout when this goes public? 
명단이 공개되면 어떻게 될지 상상이 가? 
Ooh, blood on the walls. 
아마 발칵 뒤집힐걸 
- Uh... what just happened? - The stakes were raised. 
- 어떻게 됐어? - 우리 다 들어갔어 
If you hadn't gotten indicted, we would have pipes right now. 
그래요, 당신이 이 신세만 아니면 수도관 갈고도 남았어요! 
I got indicted making money to keep you happy. 
당신위해서 돈 벌다 이랬어 
I need a favor. 
I thought as much. 그럴 줄 알았어 
You came to visit me. Even if it was for an ulterior motive. 
목적이야 어찌됐건 이렇게 찾아와줬다는 거 
Well, I guess I know what it's like to have your heart stomped on. 
지금 어떤 심정인지 잘 아는 것 뿐이야 
I hate 'em all. Look at 'em just leering at us. 
다 싫어 우리 쳐다보는 눈빛 좀 봐 
They're so cocky. They know they have the upper hand. 
너무 거만해 보여 자기들한테 주도권이 있다 이거지 
And they know it. And they just sit there, ready to pounce, 
waiting for us to take any crumb they're willing to throw our way. 
그걸 아는거지 그래서 아무 놈이나 골라서 
어서 안아달라고 달려들기만 기다리고 있는 거야 
OK. Let's say Mike's a peach. And he didn't kill Martha. Who did? 
좋아, 마이크는 좋은 사람이고 마사를 안죽였어, 그럼 누굴까? 
He clams up every time we try to ask him about Mary Alice. 
메리 앨리스 얘길 물어볼 때마다 항상 뭔가 석연치않아 
He's up to no good. 
분명히 뭔가 있어 
which is just as mortifying. 그게 더 화가 나요! - What are we gonna do? 
we'll walk out of here with all the dignity that we can muster. 
최대한 품위있고 의연하게 걸어나가는 거예요 
The police showed me your rap sheet. You killed a man. 
경찰에서 전과기록을 봤어요 당신은 사람을 죽였어요 
Mike, blind faith is not my friend. 
마이크, 내 믿음은 항상 날 배신했다고요 
Oh. Is that so?
오, 그러세요?  비꼬면서 
But the you should have some nerve crashing a six-year-old's birthday party. 
하지 만 6살짜리 생일파티를 이런 식으로 망치면 안되죠 



S1-Episode 17

The barracks are a little bit bleak but that recidivism rate is to die for. 
건물이 좀 황량해 보이긴 하지만 행동 교정률이 월등해요 
Babe, they blinked. 
드디어 틈이 생겼어! 
We got them by the short hairs. - Who? Who blinked? 
이제 승산이 있다고! - 누구 얘기예요? 
They offered a plea bargain. - And that's good? 
유죄협상제를 제안했어 - 그게 좋은 거예요? 
It means they know they got a weak case. They don't think they can win. 






S1-Episode 19

The perfect capper to the perfect evening. 
즐거운 시간은 이걸로 마치겠습니다
Oh, and your idea of helping is letting Tim just grope you? 
팀이l 더듬게 도와주는 거예요? 
What's your problem, pal? - Dude, you were feeling up her mother. 
넌 또 왜 이래? - 계속 더듬어댔잖아. 
And I'm not crabby. 
그리고 괜한 심통을 부리는 것도 아니에요 
They're such tools. 
속이기 아주 쉬웠죠


S1-Episode 20

I wanted to, but I kept putting it off. I knew how you'd react. 
계속 입이 안 떨어졌어. 당신이 어떻게 나올지 아니까 
Well, technically, Peterson found her. I just vouched for her. 
난 대답만 했어
I was just leaving you a gift to apologize for, 
you know, throwing gravel in your face. 

Aside from you blinding me? 
내 눈에 돌 던진 일 말고 또? 
OK, I realize that I was out of line that night. 
그날 제가 잘못한 건 알지만 
Please. Don't ruin this for me. 
제발 저한테 이러지 마세요 
Don't be dense(stupid). Don't you think I know my own neighbor? 
Anyway, that's rather more your speed, isn't it? 
그리고 그건 리네트 전공 아냐? 
Morning, ladies. Just coming in for a little more fuel. 
안녕, 숙녀분들 기름 좀 부으러 왔습니다 
One man's sludge is another man's liquid gold.
누군가의 진창이 다른이에겐 황금같은 기회다.

Why not subtly remind Annabel you're happily married? 
우리가 행복하다는 걸 암시해(교묘하게) 준게 뭐가 나빠? 
It wasn't subtle. And it's an insult to me. 
암시가 아니었잖아 이건 나에 대한 모욕이야 
If I'd told you on day one, you'd still jump down my throat. 
말했다가는 당장 이렇게 숨통을 조일까 봐 그랬어 
Well, Peterson's on cloud nine. He discovered some inside scoop on the Metro account. 
기분이 째져있네. 메트로 어카운트에에 비밀정보를 입수하셨대 
	inside scoop <- Information that only an insider would have.
Peterson says we might be 'pulling an all-nighter.' 
오늘 '밤을 새워서'라도 끝내놓으라는 지시야 
And when a man goes away to jail, which I hope none of
	you here ever have to do, he sees who his real friends are. So, thanks.
Just as there will always be those who prefer to sit in the dark 
brooding(곰곰이[골똘히] 생각하다) over everything they've lost.



S1-Episode 21

Reaching out from the grave to screw with me. 
땅속에 묻혀서까지 날 괴롭히다니 
Rex just hates these cooks tours. 

George: Maybe we should go to Italy. 
Bree: What?
George: Wouldn't that be a hoot? All those museum and cathedrals and fantastic retories. 
We could just make pigs of ourselves.
멋지지 않겠어요?  돼지처럼 먹어댈 수 있을거예요.


S1-Episode 22
Um, okay, If, if, if you find out something really bad, 
just try to put a positive spin on it.
그냥 긍정적으로 좀 바꿔줘.
Kendra: Right, right. The drugs. Deirdre humiliated this family and she threw o
ur love back in our faces. She knew it and she couldn't have cared less.
그래요, 맞아요. 약이죠. 디어드라는 우리 가족 이름을 더럽혔고, 우리의 사랑을 면상에 내동댕이쳤어
요. 언니도 알고 있었고 신경쓰지도 않았어요.
He and I need to hash this out. Man to man. 
남자 대 남자로 해결해야 된다. 
	<- to talk about something with someone else in order to reach agreement about it:
Felicia: I am not my sister, Paul, you do not want to screw with me. Martha 
kept a journal. Every drab event of her drab life meticulously documented. 
Including her discover that you and your wife stole a baby. A baby named Dana.
난 내 동생과 달라요, 폴, 나와는 문제를 일으키고 싶지 않겠죠. 마사는 일기를 썼어요. 단조로운 일상
의 모든 단조로운 일들을 꼼꼼하게 기록해뒀죠. 당신과 당신 아내가 아기를 훔쳤다는 사실을 알게 됐
다는 내용도 있어요. 데이나라는 이름의 아기죠.

Felicia: I'm sorry if the copies are hard to read. I hid the originals in a safe place. 
It seemed like a reasonable precaution since you murdered Martha and all. 
복사본이 읽기 어렵다면 미안해요. 원본은 안전한 곳에 숨겨뒀죠. 당신이 마사를 죽였으니까 미리 주
의하는 게 좋을 것 같았어요. 
Bree: What's the matter. You're been mopey all day.
무슨 일이야? 하루 종일 시무룩해 있잖아.
Kendra: Deirdre was. Mike, he, he kicked the habit early on, but Deirdre couldn't, or didn't want to. I don't
know. Anyway, she spiraled out of control and was in and out of jail. One day, an undercover cop caught her
using and he forced her to trade sex for freedom. Look, Mike found out about it and he tried to put a stop to it.
He busted in on the two of them. He, the cop pulled a gun on him and Mike fought him off but they both went
over the balcony. Mike was the only one that got back up.
디어드라가 마약상이었죠. 마이크는 일찍 약을 끊었어요, 하지만 디어드라는 그러질 못했죠, 아님 끊
고 싶지 않았던가, 모르겠어요. 어쨌든 언니는 통제가 안되게 됐고 감옥을 들락거렸어요. 어느 날, 비밀
경찰이 언니가 약을 쓰는 걸 붙잡았죠. 그리고, 놔주는 대신 성관계를 요구했어요. 마이크가 그 일을 알
게 됐고 막으려고 애를 썼죠. 마이크가 두 사람이 있는 현장을 잡았어요. 그가, 경찰이 마이크에게 총을
들이댔고 마이크는 저항했죠. 하지만 두 사람 다 발코니에서 떨어졌고, 마이크만이 살아남았어요.

Narrator: Edie Britt's favorite moment of every day was her arrival at the construction 
site of her new home, because she knew what was about to happen. Her sudden appearance 
was always sure to generate a few appreciative glances, a few lascivious looks, 
and some downright ogling. Sadly for Edie, the one man she wanted most to notice her...
이디 브릿이 하루 중 가장 좋아하는 때는 새 집 공사 현장에 도착하는 순간이죠, 무슨 일이 일어날지 아
니까요. 그녀가 갑자기 등장하면 늘 감상하는 시선들이 생긴답니다. 감상하는 시선, 음흉한 눈길도 있
고 노골적인 추파도 있죠. 불행하게도, 이디가 가장 자신을 봐줬으면 하는 한 남자는...


S1-Episode 22

You're an unfeeling bitch. 
감정이라곤 없는
Lee Craig has the biggest ego of any doctor I know. If he wants to consult with someone, that means he's
stumped, which means I'm screwed.
리 크레이그는 내가 아는 의사들 중에 가장 자존심이 센 사람이야. 그가 다른 사람과 상담을 하고 싶어
한다면 그 얘기는 곤란한 일이 생겼단 뜻이고 난 망했다는 소리라고.
Rex: What in god's name is your point?
도대체 무슨 소릴 하고 싶은거야?
Felicia: Okay so it's not such a stretch, the wonder if Paul avenged his wife's death 
by killing Martha for blackmailing them. But perhaps I'm alone in that.
그래서 말따가 협박을 해서 부인을 죽게 한 것 때문에 폴이 마사를 죽여서 복수했다고 생각하는 것도
무리가 아니에요. 하지만 아마 저만 그렇게 생각하는 것 같아요.
At least be man enough to own up(자백하다) to it. She would've been.
적어도 남자답게 순순히 자백해. 어머니라면 그러셨을 거야.
Bree: Forcing me to share in your depraved pasttime wasn't bad enough, 
you had to share my humiliation with your co-workers?
당신의 타락한 과거를 나도 같이 하게 만든 걸로도 모자라서, 동료들과 그런 치욕스러운 얘기를 나눠야 했어?

S1-Episode 23
Isn't it idyllic(전원적)? 
It's time that you left. 			네가 떠날 때야

Where is the baby? 
I don't know. If we'd seen a kid, we wouldn't have left it in a crack house. 
				<가정법 과거 had+p.p.>   <would have+p.p.>


Why should you fend for yourself when you can just come home with me? 
왜 혼자 있겠다고 고집을 부리니? 
Let me shoulder the burden. It would be my pleasure. 
나한테 얼마든지 의지해 기꺼이 힘이 돼줄게 
I wanted to spare you this, 
나도 그렇게 말해주고 싶지만 
	spare (one) (something)	
	To not force one to listen to or engage in something, especially that 
	which is tedious, dull, or unpleasant. 
	"I can see that you understand 	what you did wrong, so I'll spare you a lecture 
	about it. 	Spare us the lurid details, James."

You were awfully brave buying a place site unseen. 	
	보지도않고 결정하시다니 용기가 대단하세요 
	(You are awfully(extremely) brave 'buying a home sight unseen.')
Yes, well, Carlos, in some circles, beating people up at all is frowned upon. 
맞아요, 누가 그러는데 폭행은 아주 악질 범죄래요 
So if I'm gonna get you out of this mess, you have to reciprocate. 
그러니까 당신을 구해주면 당신도 그만큼 보답을 해요 	
	
Which part don't you understand?
What 	   don't you understand? 	
	
If you got a promotion, we never would have seen you. 
		You would have been traveling all the time.	
You're right. That promotion would have just killed us.	
	
This is a long way to go to do what you could have done in my back yard. 	
	
You're kind of taking your time. Walking a lot. 	   <- 시간 낭비
You self-righteous bitch. 	<- 독선적인

[신체부위별 증상 표현 - 목(NECK)]

### Finance Terminology
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLO (대출-채권-담보부-증권)
	은행의 대출채권을 묶어 풀(POOL)을 구성한 뒤 자산유동화전문회사(SPC)에 매각하고, 
	자산유동화전문회사는 풀의 대출채권을 담보로 유동화증권을 발행하는 것으로 자산유동화증권(ABS)
	의 일종임. 일반적인 경우 은행이 유동성을 확보하기 위한 수단

CMBS(Commercial Mortgage Backed Security - 부동산 증권화)
	투자은행이 상업용 부동산 담보대출을 pool로 만들어 SPC(특별목적회사) 로 소유권을 이전하여 
	그 pool에서 생긴 현금을 기초로 하여 투자자에게 지급해야할 순위를 정하고 구분한뒤 SPC가 증권을 발행한다.


	
ABS CBO / CLO 및 MBS의 차이점
	자산 유동화에 관한법률(ABS법)에서는 부동산,대출채권,매출채권,유가증권 등 모든 유형의 
	자산(재산권)을 기초로 발행되는 모든 유가증권을 총칭하여 유동화 증권(ABS:Asset Backed Securities)
	이라 정의하고 있는데 CBO/CLO는 그 유동화 자산이 사채 (주로 Junk Bond) 또는 대출채권인 유동화 증권이고 
	MBS는 그 유동화자산이 주택저당대출채권(Mortgage)인 유동화증권이라 할수 있다. 
	
	실무적으로는 ABS법에 따라 발행되는 유동화증권을 ABS(사채,출자증권,수익증권 등의 형태로 발행됨)로 
	분류하고, 주택저당채권유동화회사법(MBS법)에 따라 발행되는 유동화증권을 MBS(사채 및 수익증권 
	형태로 발행됨)로 분류하고 있다. 	
	
ABS (자산유동화채권) 

MBS (주택저당채권) 	


bonds(채권) <-	A bond is an IOU.
	Those who buy such bonds are, put simply, loaning money to the issuer for a fixed period 
	of time.

	At the end of that period, the value of the bond is repaid. Investors also receive a 
	pre-determined interest rate (the coupon) - usually paid annually.

	For example, if a company or government issues a 10-year, $100m bond with a coupon of 5% 
	it is saying, "In ten years time, I owe you $100m, and every year until then I will pay 
	you $5m interest".	
	
	However bondholders can, if they wish, sell a bond to someone else before the agreed time 
	period. And this is why bonds are interesting as the trade in them gives an indication of 
	the level confidence in the company or government issuing the bond.
	
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loan 종류
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Leveraged Loan(레버리지 론)  
	레버리지 론은 이미 부채 규모가 상당한 수준의 개인이나 기업이 더 빌린 돈을 말한다. 기업 
	인수합병(M&A)에서 인수 대상 기업의 자산을 담보로 돈을 빌리는 것도 레버리지 론에 포함된다. 
	투기등급 기업들이 빌리는 돈을 레버리지 론으로 부르기도 한다. 레버리지 론은 채무불이행(디폴트) 
	위험이 더 높은 것으로 간주되고, 따라서 더 높은 금리가 적용된다. 회사채와 달리 레버리지 론 
	발행은 증권이 아닌 대출 계약 형식이다. 채권자에게서 돈을 빌리되 변동금리가 적용되고, 이 
	때문에 금리 상승기에 채권에 비해 수익이 더 높은 장점이 있다.
