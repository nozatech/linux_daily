현재완료에서 been은 어떨 때 쓰나요? been이 어떻게 사용 
되는지 여러 가지 예문을 통해 자세히 알려주세요. 

안녕하세요? been은 말 그대로 be 동사가 현재완료의 have p.p.안에서 
쓰일 때 p.p.형으로 쓰인 겁니다. 자세히 알아볼까요? 


been은 말 그대로 be 동사가 현재완료의 have p.p. 안에서 쓰일 때, 
p.p.형으로 쓰인 겁니다. 그러므로 be 동사가 쓰이는 곳은 모두 쓰인다고 보면 되는 거죠. 

1) 현재완료진행으로 쓰일 때 

* She has been reading a book all day. (그녀는 하루 내내 책을 읽어왔다.) 
“~ 해오고 있다“ 라는 뜻을 나타내는 위와 같은 문장을, “현재완료진행시제”라고 합니다. 

일단 현재 완료 진행을 이해하기 위해서, 진행 시제에 대해서 알아 볼까요? 
여러분은! 진행 시제를 어떻게 쓰나요? 
그렇죠, be동사 + ing 의 형태입니다. 

* I am doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 하고 있습니다.) 
이런 것이 현재 진행 시제이죠. 여러분은! 현재 완료는 어떻게 쓰나요? 
그렇죠, have + p.p 의 형태입니다. 

그럼 현재완료 진행은 어떻게 쓸까요? 말 그대로, 현재완료 진행은 
현재완료 + 현재 진행 입니다. 
have + p.p + be동사 + ing = have + been(be동사의 p.p형태) + ~ing 입니다. 
뜻은 “~ 해 오고 있다” 로, 진행의 느낌이 있을 때 쓰는 거구요. 

그렇다면, 위의 문장으로, 현재완료진행 시제를 만들어 봅시다. 
* I am doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 하고 있습니다.) 
-> I have been doing my homework. (나는 숙제를 해 오고 있습니다.) 
어떤가요? 쉽지 않나요? ^-^ 

2) ~ 있다. 는 be 동사의 의미를 살려서 쓸 때 

현재완료는 be 동사에서도 똑같이 적용되어, is, are, am 등이 
have(has) + been 으로 바뀐다는 것을 알면 이해하기가 쉬울 거예요. 

예문으로 보면, 
* It has been very hot since last week. (지난 주부터 아주 더워왔다) 
이 문장을 보면, 간단히 현재완료시제의 문장 이예요. 
일단, “ 덥다 ” 라는 문장을 보면 It is hot. 이죠. 
현재완료 형태로 바꾸면 is 가 has been 이 되어서 It has been hot. 이 됩니다. 

※이와 관련해서, 날씨에 관한 현재완료 표현을 많이 질문 하시는데요, 
* It has been rainy since last Sunday. 
* It has rained since last Sunday. 
이 두 예문을 봅시다. 둘다 ‘저번 주 일요일 이후로 계속 비가 왔다’는 의미인데요. 
이 두 문장을 보고, “ been을 어디에는 붙이고 어디에는 안 붙이나요? “ 
하고 묻는 학생들이 있습니다. 

위 문장들에서는 been 을 붙이고 안 붙이고의 문제가 아니고, 
먼저 알아둬야 할 것은, “무엇이 동사인가” 하는 것 같네요. 

위의 첫 번째 문장을 봅시다. 
It has been rainy since last Sunday. (저번 주 일요일 이후로 계속 비가 오고 있다.) 
이 문장을 현재형으로 바꾸면 어떤 문장이 될까요? 
It is rainy. (비가 옵니다) 이지요? 
be 동사가 본동사인 문장이지요? 그렇기 때문에, is 가 has been 으로 변합니다. 

두 번째 문장을 보면, 
It has rained since last Sunday. (저번 주 일요일 이후로 비가 와 왔다.) 
이 문장의 현재형은 It rains. (비가 옵니다.) 이지요? 
rains 가 본동사 이므로, has rained 로 변형됩니다. 
동사가 be동사인 현재형 문장을 현재완료형으로 바꾸면, 
has(have) been 이 되는 거고, 동사가 일반 동사인 현재형 문장을 
현재완료형으로 바꾸면, have(has) + 일반 동사의 p.p 가 됩니다. 

3) “~에 갔다 오다”라는 뜻으로 쓸 때. be동사는 “~이다“ 
혹은 ”~있다“란 의미입니다. 

하지만, be 동사가 p.p. 형으로 쓰이면 go and come 
즉, “갔다 왔다“의 의미를 갖게 됩니다. 
왜 그런지 그 의미를 추측 해 봅시다. 

* I have been to New York. 이란 문장을 보면, 지금 내가 여기에서 
이야기 하고 있는데, “뉴욕에도 있었다.”란 문장을 썼으니, 
아~ 그렇다면, 뉴욕에 갔다고 온 것이군. 이란 의미가 되는 게 아닌가 싶습니다. 



"have been to"는 하나의 숙어처럼 
" ~에 갔다 왔다" 혹은 "~에 가본 적이 있다"란 말로 굳혀져서 사용하는 문구 입니다. 

하지만, be 동사가 p.p. 형 일 때만 
go and come 의 의미를 갖고, 
그냥 be동사는 ~이다, ~있다의 
의미만 갖습니다. 

그러므로 “ 나는 뉴욕에 갔다.“ 라고 
말하고 싶다면 be 동사가 아니라 
I went to New York. 이라고 말해야 합니다. 


마지막으로 been은 현재완료 수동태 문장을 만들 때도 사용됩니다. 

수동태는 be + p.p 형태를 취하므로 현재완료 수동태를 만들 때는 
be동사 역할을 하는 been이 와야 합니다. 

예를 들어, 
We have polluted water. 현재 완료 문장을 현재완료 수동태로 고치려고 한다면 
Water has been polluted by us. 의 형태가 될 수 있겠죠. 
현재완료 have p.p + 수동태 be p.p 가 합쳐져서 have been p.p의 형태가 되는 거죠.
