SSH connection error after power outage on 1/21/2017

After the power outage, using SSH (port 22) to servers are impossible due to connection errors as below.

Symptoms:
  1. Cgywin from Windows 7 using LAN 10.100.5.190 | GW 65.87.26.124
	AWS Servers
	$ ssh -i wput-puppt.pem centos@52.89.234.12
	Connection reset by 52.89.234.12 port 22
	
	DO Servers
	$ ssh apark@162.243.68.237
	Connection reset by 162.243.68.237 port 22

  2. CentOS7 Server Workstation using LAN LAN 10.100.5.155 | GW 65.87.26.125
	DO Servers
	$ssh apark@45.55.5.69
	Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer	

  3. Macbook using WIFI NamCity 10.122.2.229 | GW 65.87.26.123
	$ ssh apark@45.55.5.69
	Connection reset by 45.55.5.69 port 22


Troubleshoot
  1. Check SSH version, rename id_rsa, id_rsa.pub, known_hosts and check integrity of files
  2. Remove id* and try ssh in again, but same error.  It is not the id_rsa keys.
  3. From Macbook connect to PacCity(visitor internet) and try connect server.  All servers are blocked IP. Need to open from Puppet.
  4. Create a new server on DO and test with PacCity internet from Macbook.  It works fine without an issue.
  5. Tracking down to network issue and check with IT if ISP equipment and Firewall reboot are possible.  
	 Will be reboot on weekend but too long to wait.
  6. Try with mRemoteNG and Putty and they connect without an issue.  Need to compare the packets between Cygwin and Putty.
  7. SSH debug mode and change ssh port 2222 on Remote server to monitor.
  8. Using tcpdump, WireShark & Tshark to capture the packets for comparisons: CentOS7, Win7 Cygwin and Win7 Putty connections
  9. Packets size are different between Cygwin and Putty connections. 
    

Workaround Solution	
	
1. Change the Cipher options
	$ ssh -c aes256-ctr apark@45.55.5.69  			<= single cipher option to eliminate whole list to send
  
2. Add config file	to .SSH folder	
	$ vi .ssh/config
	Host *
	Ciphers aes256-ctr
	
3. uncomment on Ciphers and MACs in /etc/ssh/ssh_config
	$ vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config
	#Host *
	Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc
	MACs hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160
