Install the latest Mesos on CentOS 7.x

Prerequisites: Clean CentOS 7.x minimal SVR installed (tested on 7.2) + docker

Setup: single node (all-in-one), Mesosphere repo



yum install -y http://repos.mesosphere.io/el/7/noarch/RPMS/mesosphere-el-repo-7-1.noarch.rpm
 
yum install docker mesosphere-zookeeper mesos marathon chronos  -y
 
echo 'docker,mesos' > /etc/mesos-slave/containerizers
 
for SERVICES in docker zookeeper mesos-master mesos-slave marathon chronos; do
    systemctl enable $SERVICES
    systemctl restart $SERVICES
done
 
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5050/tcp # mesos-master
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5051/tcp # mesos-slave
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp # marathon
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=4400/tcp # chronos

https://dcos.io/docs/1.8/administration/installing/cloud/aws/

Microservices & Containers
Build microservices applications using Docker with Marathon: DC/OS’s production proven container orchestrator.

Big Data & Analytics
Build and integrate advanced big data, analytics and machine learning pipelines with Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra in your apps.

Infrastructure Agnostic Apps
DC/OS runs on top of any bare-metal, private or public clouds, allowing you to maintain maximum portability for all your apps.


Admin Router
The Admin Router runs on the DC/OS master servers to provide a proxy for the admin parts of the cluster.

Agent node
	A Mesos agent node runs a discrete Mesos task on behalf of a framework. It is an agent instance 
	registered with the Mesos master. The synonym of agent node is worker or slave node. 
	See also private and public agent nodes.

Bootstrap node
	The node where a custom DC/OS installation is run. For more information, see the system requirements.

Cloud template
	The cloud templates are optimized to run DC/OS. The templates are JSON-formatted text files that 
	describe the resources and properties.

Mesos Containerizer
	The Mesos Containerizer provides lightweight containerization and resource isolation of 
	executors using Linux-specific functionality such as cgroups and namespaces.

Docker Containerizer
The Docker Containerizer enables launching docker containers using DC/OS.

Datacenter operating system
	A new class of operating system that spans all of the machines in a datacenter or 
	cloud and organizes them to act as one big computer.

DC/OS
The abbreviated form of the Datacenter Operating System.

DC/OS Cluster
A group of Mesos master and agent nodes.

DC/OS Marathon
The native Marathon instance that is the “init system” for DC/OS. It starts and monitors DC/OS applications and services.

DC/OS service
	DC/OS services are applications that are packaged and available from the public GitHub package repositories. 
	Available DC/OS services include Mesos frameworks and other applications.

Executor
	A framework running on top of Mesos consists of two components: a scheduler that registers with the 
	master to be offered resources, and an executor process that is launched on agent nodes to run the 
	framework’s tasks. For more information about framework schedulers and executors, 
	see the App/Framework development guide.

Exhibitor for ZooKeeper
	DC/OS uses ZooKeeper, a high-performance coordination service to manage the installed DC/OS services. 
	Exhibitor automatically configures your ZooKeeper installation on the master nodes during your DC/OS installation.

Framework
	A Mesos framework is the combination of a Mesos scheduler and an optional custom executor. A framework receives 
	resource offers describing CPU, RAM, etc. from the leading Mesos master, and allocates them for discrete tasks 
	that can be launched on Mesos agent nodes. Mesosphere-certified Mesos frameworks, called DC/OS services, 
	are packaged and available from public GitHub package repositories. DC/OS services include Mesosphere-certified 
	Mesos frameworks and other applications.

Master
	A Mesos master aggregates resource offers from all agent nodes and provides them to registered frameworks. 
	For more details about the Mesos master, read about Mesos Master Configuration.

Mesos-DNS
	Mesos-DNS is a DC/OS component that provides service discovery within the cluster. Mesos-DNS allows 
	applications and services that are running on Mesos to find each other by using the domain name system (DNS), 
	similar to how services discover each other throughout the Internet.

Package repository
	DC/OS services are applications that are packaged and available from the public DC/OS package 
	repositories that are hosted on GitHub.

Offer
	An offer represents available resources (e.g. cpu, disk, memory) which an agent reports to the master 
	and the master offers to the registered frameworks in some order.

Private agent node
	Private agent nodes run DC/OS apps and services through a non-routable network that is only accessible from the 
	admin zone or through the edgerouter from the public zone. By default DC/OS launches apps on private agent nodes. 
	DC/OS agent nodes can be designated as public or private during installation. For more information, 
	see the Network Security documentation.

Public agent node
	Public agent nodes run DC/OS apps and services in a publicly accessible network. DC/OS agent nodes can be 
	designated as public or private during installation. For more information see:

Network Security
	Creating a public agent node

Slave
	The synonym of slave node is worker or agent node. A Mesos agent node runs a discrete Mesos task on behalf of a framework. 
	It is an agent instance registered with the Mesos master.

State abstraction
	Mesos provides an abstraction for accessing storage for schedulers for Java and C++ only. 
	This is the preferred method to access ZooKeeper for DC/OS services.

Task
	A unit of work scheduled by a Mesos framework and executed on a Mesos agent. In Hadoop terminology, 
	this is a “job”. In MySQL terminology, this is a “query” or “statement”. A task may simply be a Bash command, 
	a Python script, or a complex AI application.

Working directory
	A Mesos master requires a directory on the local file system to write replica logs to.

ZooKeeper
	DC/OS uses ZooKeeper, a high-performance coordination service to manage the installed DC/OS services. 
	Exhibitor automatically configures your ZooKeeper installation on the master nodes during your DC/OS installation.
