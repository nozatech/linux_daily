"objects" from these buckets.

s3cmd [options] COMMAND [parameters]
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --configure           Invoke interactive (re)configuration tool. Optionally
                        use as '--configure s3://some-bucket' to test access
                        to a specific bucket instead of attempting to list
                        them all.
  -c FILE, --config=FILE
                        Config file name. Defaults to $HOME/.s3cfg
  --dump-config         Dump current configuration after parsing config files
                        and command line options and exit.

                        AWS Access Key
  --secret_key=SECRET_KEY
                        AWS Secret Key
  -n, --dry-run         Only show what should be uploaded or downloaded but
                        don't actually do it. May still perform S3 requests to
                        get bucket listings and other information though (only
                        for file transfer commands)
  -s, --ssl             Use HTTPS connection when communicating with S3.
                        (default)
  --no-ssl              Don't use HTTPS.
  -e, --encrypt         Encrypt files before uploading to S3.
  --no-encrypt          Don't encrypt files.
  -f, --force           Force overwrite and other dangerous operations.
  --continue            Continue getting a partially downloaded file (only for
                        [get] command).
  --continue-put        Continue uploading partially uploaded files or
                        multipart upload parts.  Restarts/parts files that
                        don't have matching size and md5.  Skips files/parts
                        that do.  Note: md5sum checks are not always
                        sufficient to check (part) file equality.  Enable this
                        at your own risk.
  --upload-id=UPLOAD_ID
                        UploadId for Multipart Upload, in case you want
                        continue an existing upload (equivalent to
                        put) and there are multiple partial uploads.  Use
                        s3cmd multipart [URI] to see what UploadIds are
                        associated with the given URI.
  --skip-existing       Skip over files that exist at the destination (only
                        for [get] and [sync] commands).
  -r, --recursive       Recursive upload, download or removal.
  --check-md5           Check MD5 sums when comparing files for [sync].
                        (default)
  --no-check-md5        Do not check MD5 sums when comparing files for [sync].
                        Only size will be compared. May significantly speed up
                        transfer but may also miss some changed files.
  -P, --acl-public      Store objects with ACL allowing read for anyone.
  --acl-private         Store objects with default ACL allowing access for you
                        only.
