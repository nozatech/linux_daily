HTTP - PUT vs POST
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107390/whats-the-difference-between-a-post-and-a-put-http-request
POST - To create document or any other resource
PUT - To update the created document or any other resource.

1) GET		<- Used when the client is requesting a resource on the Web server.
2) HEAD		<- Used when the client is requesting some information about a 
				resource but not requesting the resource itself.
3) POST		<- Used when the client is sending information or data to the server—for example, 
				filling out an online form (i.e. Sends a large amount of complex data to the Web Server).
4) PUT		<- Used when the client is sending a replacement document or uploading a new document 
				to the Web server under the request URL.
5) DELETE	<- Used when the client is trying to delete a document from the Web server, 
				identified by the request URL.
6) TRACE	<- Used when the client is asking the available proxies or intermediate servers 
				changing the request to announce themselves.
7) OPTIONS	<- Used when the client wants to determine other available methods to retrieve 
				or process a document on the Web server.
8) CONNECT	<- Used when the client wants to establish a transparent connection to a remote host, 
				usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an HTTP proxy.

3. What is the command used to check any hardware changes made on the system in Linux?
	kudzu

4. Is it possible to increase swap partition? If yes then how?
	How to increase size of swap partition

5. What is a swap partition ? What is the recommended swap partition for 8 GB RAM?
	Ans: Swap partition is a feature used in Linux which uses the space allocated to it from the physical hard drive and is utilized by te system when RAM memory goes full.
	e.g. 4GB of RAM or less  a minimum of 2GB of swap space

6. What is the procedure you follow to extend a LVM partition?
	lvextend -L +1G /dev/VolGroup/LogVol1
	This will extend the partition size by +1 GB

22. What is initrd image and what is its function in the linux booting process?
	The initial RAM disk (initrd) is an initial root file system that is mounted prior to when 
	the real root file system is available.The initrd is bound to the kernel and loaded as part 
	of the kernel boot procedure. The kernel then mounts this initrd as part of the two-stage 
	boot process to load the modules to make the real file systems available and get at the 
	real root file system. Thus initrd image plays a vital role in linux booting process.

23. 2. Explain the terms suid, sgid and sticky bit?
	In addition to the basic file permissions in Linux, there are few special permissions that 
	are available for executable files and directories.
	SUID : If setuid bit is set, when the file is executed by a user, the process will have the 
			same rights as the owner of the file being executed.

	SGID : Same as above, but inherits group privileges of the file on execution, not user 
			privileges. Similar way when you create a file within the directory, it will 
			inherit the group ownership of the directories.

	Sticky bit : Sticky bit was used on executables in linux so that they would remain in the 
				memory more time after the initial execution, hoping they would be needed in 
				the near future. But mainly it is on folders, to imply that a file or folder 
				created inside a stickybit enabled folder could only be deleted by the owner. 
				A very good implementation of sticky bit is /tmp , where every user has write 
				permission but only users who own a file can delete them.
				
24. List out few of the differences between Softlink and Hardlink?
	a) Hardlink cannot be created for directories. Hard link can only be created for a file.
	b) Symbolic links or symlinks can link to a directory.
	c) Removing the original file that your hard link points to does not remove the hardlink 
		itself; the hardlink still provides the content of the underlying file.
	d) If you remove the hard link or the symlink itself, the original file will stay intact.
	e) Removing the original file does not remove the attached symbolic link or symlink, but 
		without the original file, the symlink is useless

25. How do you sent a mail attachment via bash console?
	"mutt" is an opensource tool for sending emails with attachments from the linux bash 
	command line. We can install "mutt" from the binary rpm or via package manager.
	$ mutt -s "Subject of Mail" -a "path of attachment file" "email address of recipient" \
		< "message text containing body of the message"
	$ mutt -s "Backup Data" -a /home/backup.tar.gz admin@mywebsite.com < /tmp/message.txt	

26. What is the difference between umask and ulimit ?
	umask stands for ‘User file creation mask’, 
		which determines the settings of a mask that controls which file permissions are set 
		for files and directories when they are created. 
	While ulimit is a linux built in command which provides control over the resources available 
		to the shell and/or to processes started by it.

	You can limit user to specific range by editing /etc/security/limits.conf at the same time 
	system wide settings can be updated in /etc/sysctl.conf	

27. What are the run levels in linux and how to change them?
	A run level is a state of init and the whole system that defines what system services are operating and they are identified by numbers.There are 7 different run levels present (run level 0-6) in Linux system for the different purpose. The descriptions are given below.
	0: Halt System (To shutdown the system)
	1: Single user mode
	2: Basic multi user mode without NFS
	3: Full multi user mode (text based)
	4: unused
	5: Multi user mode with Graphical User Interface
	6: Reboot System
	To change the run level, edit the file “/etc/inittab” and change initdefault entry 
	( id:5:initdefault:). If we want to change the run level on the fly, it can be done using 
	‘init’ command.
	e.g. ‘init 3' in the command line , this will move the system from current runlevel to 
		runlevl 3. Current level can be listed by typing the command 'who -r'	

28. What is SeLinux?
	Security-enhanced Linux. It is an access control implementation 
	and security feature for the Linux kernel. It is designed to protect the server against 
	misconfigurations and/or compromised daemons. It put limits and instructs server daemons 
	or programs what files they can access and what actions they can take by defining a 
	security policy.
	
29. What are inodes in Linux ? How to find the inode associated with a file ?
	$ df -i /root
	An inode is a data structure on a filesystem on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems 
	that stores all the information about a file except its name and its actual data. When a file 
	is created, it is assigned both a name and an inode number, which is an integer that is 
	unique within the filesystem. Both the file names and their corresponding inode numbers 
	are stored as entries in the directory that appears to the user to contain the files. The 
	concept of inodes is particularly important to the recovery of damaged filesystems. When 
	parts of the inode are lost, they appear in the lost+found directory within the partition 
	in which they once existed.

	The inode entries store metadata about each file, directory or object, but only points to 
	these structures rather than storing the data. Each entry is 128 bytes in size. The metadata 
	contained about each structure can include the following:

	Inode number
	Access Control List (ACL)
	Extended attribute
	Direct/indirect disk blocks
	Number of blocks
	File access, change and modification time
	File deletion time
	File generation number
	File size
	File type
	Group
	Number of links
	Owner
	Permissions
	Status flags
	
	$ ls -i
	Inode structure of a directory consists of a name to inode mapping of files and directories 
	in that directory.In a directory, You can find the inode number corresponding to the files 
	using the command ls -i
	
30. What is IO Block 4096	
	how big byte chunks is the data handled on the disk
	https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/345984/understanding-io-block-size/345990
	Spindle hard disk drives, with small capacity:
		logical sector = physical sector = IO block = 512 bytes
	fast hard/SSD disk drives, with high capacity:
		logical sector = physical sector = 512 bytes, IO block = 4096	

31. Why should I use DAS either NAS or SAN
	DAS - direct attached storage e.g. /dev/sda1
	NAS - Network Attached Storage
	SAN - block level storage solution that NAS doesn’t provide.
		Network attached /dev/sda1 using Fiber channel

32. A) rsync command
		$ rsync -aH sourcedir targetdir
	B) sed command
		$ sed '/regex/{x;p;x;}'
	# change "scarlet" or "ruby" or "puce" to "red"
		$ sed 's/scarlet/red/g;s/ruby/red/g;s/puce/red/g'
	C) awk command
		$ awk -F':' '{ print $1 }' /etc/group
		$ date | awk '{print $2 " " $6}'
	D) lsof command
		# List processes which opened a specific file
			$ lsof /var/log/syslog
		# lists all open files belonging to processes owned by the user
			$ lsof -u username
		# Kill all process that belongs to a particular user
			$kill -9 `lsof -t -u username
		# List all network connections
			$ lsof -i
		# List all network files in use by a specific process
			$ lsof -i -a -c ssh
		# List processes which are listening on a particular port
			$ lsof -i :25
	E) grep command	
		$ netstat -plunt | grep firefox

41. What is the difference between Name based virtual hosting and IP based virtual hosting? 	
		
		
		
		
42. What is network bonding in Linux and where the important configuration files involved? 
	What is the advantage of Network Bonding?
	Network Bonding is a Linux kernel feature that allows to aggregate multiple network 
	interfaces into a single virtual link. This is a great way to achieve redundant links, 
	fault tolerance or load balancing networks in production system. If one of the physical 
	NIC is down or unplugged, it will automatically move traffic to the other NIC card. 
	Similar way the bonding will increase the interface throughput to handle the traffic 
	it it is configured in active-active mode.	
		
		/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0
		/etc/modprobe.d/bonding.conf
		/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth[0-4]
		/proc/net/bonding/bond0
		
		
		
43. What is drop cache in Linux and how do you clear it ?
	To free pagecache:
		$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
	To free dentries and inodes:
		$ echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
	
	To free pagecache, dentries and inodes:
		$echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
	
	This is a non-destructive operation in normal scenarios and will only free things that are 
	completely unused. Dirty objects will continue to be in use until written out to disk and 
	are not freeable. However it is always preferred to run "sync" first to flush useful things 
	out to disk.		
		
44. Explain the different Scenarios involved in TCP 3 way handshake?
	The TCP three way handshake is the process for establishing a TCP connection.  
	We can explain 3 way handshake with a simple scenario where we assume a client 
	computer is contacting a server to send it some information.

	a) A client sends a packet SYN bit set and a sequence number of N ==>  SERVER.
	b) SERVER reply an ACK number of N+1, the SYN bit set and a sequence number of X ==> CLIENT.
	c) The client sends a packet with an ACK number of X+1 and the connection is established.
	d) The client sends the data.
		
		
45. What is swappiness in Linux Memory Management and how do we configure that?
	The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of 
	physical memory and onto the swap disk.
	swappiness = 0(no use swap) and 100(use 100% of swap sapce)
	Ubuntu's default is 60
	$cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
	$sysctl vm.swappiness
		vm.swappiness = 60
	Change
	$ vi /etc/sysctl.conf
		vm.swappiness = 50  	
	$ sysctl vm.swappiness=50

44. As the disk space utilization was so high in the server, the Administrator has removed few 
	files from the server but still the disk utilization is showing as high. What would be the reason?

	In Linux even if we remove a file from the mounted file system, that will still be in use by some 
	application and for this application, it remains available. Its because file descriptor in 
	/proc/filesystem is held open.. So if there are such open descriptors to files already removed, 
	space occupied by them considered as used. You find this difference by checking them using the 
	"df" and "du" commands. While df is to show the file system usage, du is to report the file 
	space usage. du works from files while df works at filesystem level, reporting what the kernel 
	says it has available.

	You can find all unlinked but held open files with:
	$ lsof | grep '(deleted)'
	
	This will list the filename which is open with the pid in which it is running. We can kill those 
	PIDs and which will stop these process and will recover the disk space responsible for this file.

Top 30 Linux System Admin & DevOps Q & A

45. Why LVM is required ?
	Answer: LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager, to resize filesystem’s size online we required LVM partition 
	in Linux. Size of LVM partition can be extended and reduced using the lvextend & lvreduce commands respectively.

46. How To check Memory stats and CPU stats ?
	Answer:  Using ‘free –m ’ & ‘vmstat’ command we can display the physical and virtual memory statistics respectively. 
		With the help of ‘sar’ command we see the CPU utilization & other stats.
	vmstat - report virtual memory statistics
	       - vmstat reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, disks and cpu activity.

47. What does Sar provides and at which location Sar logs are stored ?
	Answer: sar (system active report is part of the sysstat package) collect, report, or save system activity information. 
	The default version of the sar command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs 
	to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent 
	(user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.  -20 highest vs 19 lowest priority
	Log =>  /var/log/sysstat/saXX( date) file, where the dd parameter indicates the current day.
	Using sar you can monitor performance of various Linux subsystems (CPU, Memory, I/O..) in real time.
	Using sar, you can also collect all performance data on an on-going basis, store them, 
	and do historical analysis to identify bottlenecks.
	# sar 1 3     		               <= system CPU statistics 3 times (with 1 second interval).
	# strings  /var/log/sysstat/sa20   <= strings read binary to human readable 

	Sar is part of the sysstat package.
	1.	Collective CPU usage
	2.	Individual CPU statistics
	3.	Memory used and available
	4.	Swap space used and available
	5.	Overall I/O activities of the system
	6.	Individual device I/O activities
	7.	Context switch statistics
	8.	Run queue and load average data
	9.	Network statistics
	10.	Report sar data from a specific time


48. How to increase the size of LVM partition ?
	– Use the lvextend command (lvextend -L +100M /dev/<Name of the LVM Partition>
	– resize2fs /dev/<Name of the LVM Partition>
	– check the size of partition using ‘df -h’ command

49. How to reduce the size of LVM partition ?
	-Umount the filesystem using umount command,
	-use resize2fs command
	 $ resiz2fs /dev/mapper/myvg-mylv 10G
	-Now use the lvreduce command  
	 $ lvreduce -L 10G /dev/mapper/myvg-mylv		<=shrink the size 10GB
 
	
50. How to create partition from the raw disk ?
	Answer: Using fdisk utility we can create partitions from the raw disk.
	– fdisk  /dev/hd* (IDE) or /dev/sd* (SCSI)
	– Type n to create a new partition
	– After creating partition, type w command to write the changes to the partition table.

51. Where the kernel modules are located ?
	Answer: The ‘/lib/modules/kernel-version/’ directory stores all kernel modules or compiled drivers in Linux 
	operating system. Also with ‘lsmod’ command we can see all the installed kernel modules.
	lsmod prints the contents of the /proc/modules file. It shows which loadable kernel modules are currently loaded.

52. What is umask ?
	Umask stands for ‘User file creation mask’, which determines the settings of a mask that controls 
	which file permissions are set for files and directories when they are created.

53. How to set the umask permanently for a user?
	It has to be put in the appropriate profile file which depends on the default shell of the user.

54. How to change the default run level in linux ?
	Edit '/etc/inittab' and change initdefault entry ( id:5:initdefault:). 
	Using ‘init’ command we change the run level temporary like ‘init 3’ , this command will move the 
	system in runlevl 3.

55. How to share a directory using nfs ?
	To share a directory using nfs , first edit the configuration file ‘/etc/exportfs’ , add a entry like
	‘/<directory-name>  <ip or Network>(Options)’ and then restart the nfs service.

56. How to check and mount nfs share ?
	Using ‘showmount’ command we can see what directories are shared via nfs e.g ‘showmount -e <ip address of nfs server>’.
	Using 'mount' command we can mount the nfs share on linux machine.

57. What are the default ports used for SMTP,DNS,FTP,DHCP,SSH and squid ?
	SMTP        25
	DNS         53
	FTP         20 (data transfer) , 21 ( Connection established)
	DHCP        67/UDP(dhcp server) , 68/UDP(dhcp client)
	SSH         22
	Squid       3128

58. What is Network Bonding ?
	Network bonding is the aggregation of multiple Lan cards into a single bonded interface to provide fault tolerance 
	and high performance. Network bonding is also known as NIC Teaming.

59. What  are the different modes of Network bonding in Linux ?
	balance-rr or 0 – round-robin mode for fault tolerance and load balancing.
	active-backup or 1 – Sets active-backup mode for fault tolerance.
	balance-xor or 2 – Sets an XOR (exclusive-or) mode for fault tolerance and load balancing.
	broadcast or 3 – Sets a broadcast mode for fault tolerance. All transmissions are sent on all slave interfaces.
	802.3ad or 4  – Sets an IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation mode. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed & duplex settings.
	balance-tlb or 5 –  Sets a Transmit Load Balancing (TLB) mode for fault tolerance & load balancing.
	balance-alb or 6 –  Sets an Active Load Balancing (ALB) mode for fault tolerance & load balancing.

60. How to check and verify the status the bond interface.
	$cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0’ , we can check which mode is enabled and what lan cards are used in this bond. 
	In this example we have one only one bond interface but we can have multiple bond interface like bond1, bond2 
	and so on.

61. How to check default route and routing table ?
	$ netstat –rn    	<= r – route, n - numerical
    $ route -n   		<= n - numerical (route and routing tables.)

######### Puppet Questions

Q:25 What is Puppet Server ?
Answer: Puppet is an open-source & enterprise software for configuration management toll in UNIX like operating system.  Puppet is a  IT automation software used to push configuration to its clients (puppet agents) using code. Puppet code can do a variety of tasks from installing new software, to check file permissions, or updating user accounts & lots of other tasks.

Q:26 What are manifests in Puppet ?
Answer: Manifests in Puppet are the files in which the client configuration is specified.

Q:27 Which Command is used to sign requested certificates in Puppet Server ?
Answer: ‘puppetca  –sign hostname-of-agent’ in (2.X)  & ‘puppet ca  sign hostname-of-agent’ in  (3.X)

Q:28  At which location  Puppet Master Stores Certificates ?
Answer:  /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/signed

  =======User Management Related=======

1) Which files stores the user min UID, max UID, password expiration settings, password encryption method being used etc.,?

ANS : /etc/login.defs


2) How do you make a file copied to a new user account automatically upon user account creation?

ANS : Store the file in /etc/skel directory.

 
3) Fields in /etc/passwd:

ANS : - UserName  Password UserID GroupID Comments HomeDir LoginShell

<Couple of lines from /etc/passwd file are pasted below for reference>

redhat:x:500:500:Redhat User:/home/redhat:/bin/bash
mssm:x:501:501:another user:/home/mssm:/bin/bash

- "x" in the password column indicates that the encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file.


4) Command to lock an user account:

ANSWER: This can be done by using either "usermod -L <UserName>" or "passwd -l <UserName>" commands.

  Example:-
#usermod -L mango

Once an account gets locked, there would be an exclamation mark before the encrypted password files in /etc/shadow
mango:!$1$O5zV5Rj/$XhuRe8Og.AiXMXDGSIsae/:16266:0:99999:7:::

To un-lock an account:- 
#usermod -U mango


5) How to disable user login via terminals?

ANSWER: Add /sbin/nologin field instead of /bin/bash in /etc/passwd file.


6) Command normally recommended to edit /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files:

ANSWER: vipw > edit the user password file (/etc/passwd)
            vigr > edit the user group file(/etc/group)
            vipw -s > to edit shadow password file (/etc/shadow)
            vigr -s > to edit shadow group file (/etc/gshadow)

These commands would normally lock the file while editing to avoid corruption.


7) When an user tries to login via terminal, system would throw up the error "The account is currently not available" how could this be fixed? OR via GUI when he enters the password, it looks to be logging in, however, comes back to the login prompt?

ANSWER: This is because of the shell filed set as /sbin/nologin in /etc/passwd file, so change this back to /bin/bash and user would be able to login successfully.

If the shell filed is set as /bin/false then whenever user tries to login he would not get any error or messages, it just comes back to the prompt. Same happens in GUI mode. Can also use "system-config-users" in GUI.


8) How do you make a new user to reset his password upon his first login?

{ The prompt should come up like below }

[redhat@localhost ~]$ su - mango
Password:
You are required to change your password immediately (root enforced)
Changing password for mango.
(current) UNIX password:

{ The prompt should come up like above }

ANSWER: Use chage command and set the expiration date as given below

[root@localhost skel]# chage -d 0 mango

<< To view password aging details >>

[root@localhost skel]# chage -l mango
Last password change : password must be changed
Password expires : password must be changed
Password inactive : password must be changed
Account expires : never
Minimum number of days between password change : 0
Maximum number of days between password change : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires : 7


9) Create users home directory in /home1 directory instead of default /home directory. This gets applicable to any new users who gets created i.e the home directory of that user should be /home1/<UserName>/

ANSWER: - Edit /etc/default/useradd
- Change the line : HOME=/home1
- Save the changes and exit. After this any new users home directory would be under /home1

- You could check the useradd defaults using the command :#useradd -D

OR

#cat /etc/default/useradd

After this you can add users with the command "useradd <UserName>". This would create the users home directory with the name of the user under the specified HOME directory as defined in /etc/default/useradd.


EXAMPLE:- adding user with "-d"

[root@Redhat5Lvm ~]# useradd -d /root/doctor alldoctors
[root@Redhat5Lvm ~]# grep alldoctors /etc/passwd
alldoctors:x:912:913::/root/doctor:/bin/bash
[root@Redhat5Lvm ~]# ls -ali /root/doctor/
total 28
607780 drwx------ 3 alldoctors alldoctors 4096 Aug 3 00:31 .
543457 drwxr-x--- 18 root root 4096 Aug 3 00:31 ..
608253 -rw-r--r-- 1 alldoctors alldoctors 33 Aug 3 00:31 .bash_logout
608252 -rw-r--r-- 1 alldoctors alldoctors 176 Aug 3 00:31 .bash_profile
608251 -rw-r--r-- 1 alldoctors alldoctors 124 Aug 3 00:31 .bashrc
608248 drwxr-xr-x 4 alldoctors alldoctors 4096 Aug 3 00:31 .mozilla


10) How do you make/grant complete access (rwx) on files created for a user and deny any level of access to others including group?

ANS : - Need to define the umask value for the required user.
- This can be done by editing .bash_profile file.

For example, if we need to define this for a user "mmurthy" then we need to edit this file "/home/mmurthy/.bash_profile" and define umask as given below (assuming that the default home directory location is not changed):

umask 0077

- Save and exit the file.
- Next time this user logs in, files/directories would get exclusive permissions only for this user as masked by umask parameter.
- For root user the umask is defined in "/etc/init.d/functions" file. Otherwise, in /etc/profile (login shell) or /etc/bashrc  (non-login shell) file.


11) How to check if an user account has been locked?

ANSWER:-  Run the command "passwd -S <UserName>", this would show if the password has been locked or not. Otherwise, grep for the username from /etc/shadow file and you could see "!" mark prefixed to the encrypted password field. 

[root@server6 ~]# passwd -S smurthy
smurthy LK 1970-01-01 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)

[root@server6 ~]# grep smurthy /etc/shadow
smurthy:!!$6$jZqvS4ju$k.o6o7OoL7EZ1Bn52uPKeI2gqA76A7qyTl2PM8192jF2mz4ssVTz/u8DfbY2zJ7xCjFymh5FuATWxW5RxFugM1:0:0:99999:7:::

If you notice a double exclamation mark here ("!!") this indicates that the account got locked-up by running the command "passwd -l <UserName>" command (available only for root user). Otherwise, a single exclamation mark indicates that the account got locked with the command "usermod -L <UserName>". Accounts locked with usermod command would record it in /var/log/secure file by default. 

To "unlock" an user account, run this command "passwd -u <UserName">. Otherwise, run "usermod -U <UserName" command twice to get rid off double exclamation marks in the encrypted password field. 

Otherwise, "usermod -U <UserName" would unlock an account locked by the "usermod -L <UserName>" command.

EXAMPLE:-

[root@server6 ~]# grep smurthy /etc/shadow
smurthy:!!$6$jZqvS4ju$k.o6o7OoL7EZ1Bn52uPKeI2gqA76A7qyTl2PM8192jF2mz4ssVTz/u8DfbY2zJ7xCjFymh5FuATWxW5RxFugM1:0:0:99999:7:::
 
[root@server6 ~]# passwd -S smurthy
smurthy LK 1970-01-01 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)

[root@server6 ~]# passwd -u smurthy
Unlocking password for user smurthy.
passwd: Success
 
[root@server6 ~]# grep smurthy /etc/shadow
smurthy:$6$jZqvS4ju$k.o6o7OoL7EZ1Bn52uPKeI2gqA76A7qyTl2PM8192jF2mz4ssVTz/u8DfbY2zJ7xCjFymh5FuATWxW5RxFugM1:0:0:99999:7:::
 
[root@server6 ~]# passwd -S smurthy
smurthy PS 1970-01-01 0 99999 7 -1 (Password set, SHA512 crypt.)


12) How to find out the shadow password encryption method being used in linux? How could this be changed (example : from md5 to sha512)?

 ANSWER:-  We can find out the password encryption method being used for shadow passwords as shown below:

- Check in /etc/login.defs
    [root@server8 ~]# grep -i crypt /etc/login.defs
    # Use SHA512 to encrypt password.
    ENCRYPT_METHOD MD5
    MD5_CRYPT_ENAB yes

OR

- Check using "authconfig" command:
    [root@server8 ~]# authconfig --test|grep hashing
    password hashing algorithm is md5

OR

- Check the password beginning character in the second field of /etc/shadow file:

If it begins with = $6 > indicates sha512
                                    $5 > sha256
                                    $1 > md5    
Examples:

ty2:$6$EyoeIHFK$L2PAXcXRo.Q5Y7zUweYkste8PtiL/CqYJ9Z/ydBvRIOqvsegpVtOU1hDfkFdUpTcmjEou4kzL/Ej5MF2HdAB7.:16378:3:100:7::16489:

ty3:$5$Bsv43yG6$/Oa4fhlKF65XW8ROohKnJaSxVIIEhUKFUEdiIcOEfY4:16378:0:99999:7:::

ty5:$1$5J4jzULD$dKGfhSIzXp50Y4mwZxcqB/:16379:0:99999:7:::

To Change Password Encryption Method to sha512:

#authconfig --passalgo=sha512 --update {this would change the password encryption method to sha512}

Verify if it got changed successfully:

[root@server8 ~]# grep -i crypt /etc/login.defs
# Use SHA512 to encrypt password.
ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
MD5_CRYPT_ENAB no

[root@server8 ~]# authconfig --test|grep hashing
 password hashing algorithm is sha512 


13) What are the possible causes when an user failed to login into a linux system (physical/remote console); despite providing proper credentials? 

ANSWER:-  Here are the possible reasons why an user fails to login into console:

- Account Locked.
 
When user tries to login via GUI receive an error "authentication failure" after entering password and it goes back to the user list prompt. 

In CLI mode, after entering user password, it would fail with an error "incorrect password". However, if user tries "su" from root account, access would get granted. 

- Account Expired.
  
When account expired, an error notifying about the same would be shown up.
  
- Shell Disabled
 
After entering password in GUI, system shows a progress, however, could come back the login prompt. When this user attempts login via CLI, would receive an error "This account is currently not available".  For example, do disable shell of an user "test" : #usermod -s /sbin/nologin test (this only locks only terminal login, however, GUI login would work)
 
- Only Non-root Users Failed To Login.
 
  If all non-root users are unable to login via GUI/CLI, however, root could login then this could be because of the file "/etc/nologin" presence on the system.
 
- Only Non-root Users Failed To Login in CLI.
 
If all non-root users are unable to login via CLI, however, can login via GUI then it would be because of /tmp space limitations. Need to check if /tmp is configured and mounted separately and check free space under /tmp.

- User login failed from GUI or from text console, however, could do su.

If an user fails to login from GUI/Console, however, could login from other user accounts by running 'su' then it could be due to pam restrictions. One could use "pam_access" module to restrict login. Need to add :

account      required     pam _access.so

to files : /etc/pam.d/login & /etc/pam.d/gdm-*

After this add " - : <UserName> : ALL " to /etc/security/access.conf file. For example to limit user "test", we could add below line to access.conf file;

- : test : ALL

{{ there would an error "permission denied" in GUI  when user is restricted to login via pam}}
 
- Only root user login failed from console, however, works in GUI.

This could be because of no terminals available or defined in /etc/securetty file. 

If an user failed to login remotely via ssh then the reasons could be different. Here are the reasons: 


- User Restricted.
  
If "AllowUsers" parameter is configured in /etc/ssh/sshd_config then need to add required user to this list to get access. 
  
- Max Logins Set.
 
If "maxlogins" parameter is set in /etc/security/limits.conf then user would be allowed up to the parameter set and further connections would be denied. There could be "maxsyslogins" configured as well to limit concurrent access to a system.



14) How to manually add user without using "useradd/adduser" or "system-config-user" utilities? 

ANSWER: Create required directory under /home (default home directory for all local users) and set permissions.

#mkdir /home/user1
#chmod 700 /home/user1

[root@host1 mail]# ls -ld /home/user1
drwx------. 4 user1 user1 4096 Jan 24 07:19 /home/user1


<> Now, edit /etc/passwd file to manually set required parameters for the new user "user1":

#vipw (this command would block multiple edits of /etc/passwd file)

user1:x:2000:2000:local user:/home/user1:/bin/bash

[root@host1 ~]# grep user1 /etc/passwd

user1:x:2000:2000:local user:/home/user1:/bin/bash

<> Create required group by editing /etc/group file using command 'vigr':

#vigr
user1:x:2000:

<> Next step is to create the local profile files for the new user by copying from /etc/skel. 

[root@host1 ~]# cp -arv /etc/skel/. /home/user1
`/etc/skel/./.bash_profile' -> `/home/user1/./.bash_profile'
`/etc/skel/./.bash_logout' -> `/home/user1/./.bash_logout'
`/etc/skel/./.mozilla' -> `/home/user1/./.mozilla'
`/etc/skel/./.mozilla/extensions' -> `/home/user1/./.mozilla/extensions'
`/etc/skel/./.mozilla/plugins' -> `/home/user1/./.mozilla/plugins'
`/etc/skel/./.gnome2' -> `/home/user1/./.gnome2'
`/etc/skel/./.bashrc' -> `/home/user1/./.bashrc'


<> Change permissions of all the files under /home/user1 to be owned by new user:
#chown -R user1:user1 /home/user1

- Try logging in as new user and test.

For user mail requirement, need to create a proper file under /var/spool/mail (default mail box location) with username and permissions:
#cd /var/spool/mail
#touch user1
#chown user1:mail user1
#chmod 660 user1




  =======Shell Scripting Related=======

1) How to create simple shell scripts in Linux?

ANSWER: Make sure that the file begins with "#!/bin/bash" before any command lines. Make it executable : chmod +x <filename>. Executed by running "sh <filename.sh>" OR <./filename.sh>".


2) Which command to be used to check the shell being used?

ANSWER: echo $SHELL




  =======Log File Related=======

1) Where are the log files stored usually in linux?

ANSWER: under /var/log

 
2) How to check if the syslog service is running in RHEL6?

ANSWER: /etc/init.d/rsyslog status OR service rsyslog status

 
3) By default log files are set to get rotated on weekly basis, how to make this gets rotated on monthly basis?

ANSWER: Edit /etc/logrotate.conf and change below lines

# rotate log files monthly
monthly

Save changes and if you want to rotate the log files immediately then run the command:

#logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

 
4) How do you check the boot messages (kernel ring buffer)?

ANSWER:- Using "dmesg" or #cat /var/log/dmesg


5) How to increase size of 'kernel ring buffer' file (dmesg)?

ANSWER:- By default the kernel ring buffer size is 512 bytes. So, to increase this space add "log_buf_len=4M" to the kernel stanza in grub.conf file.  

6) What does /var/log/wtmp and /var/log/btmp files indicates and what do they store? 

ANSWER:- These files are used to store user login/logout details since from the date of creation. 

The user login, logout, terminal type etc are stored in /var/log/wtmp and this is not a user-readable file, so "last" command reads data from this file (or the file designated by the -f flag). 

All un-successful(bad) login attempts are recorded in /var/log/btmp which could be displayed using the command "lastb". All these login/logout events would also get recorded in /var/log/secure file (this file usually stores all authentication/authorization events).

Like-wise, there is /var/log/lastlog which records most previous successful login event of users. In earlier RHEL versions (RHEL 5.x) there used to be a file /var/log/faillog to hold failed login events which had become obsolete since RHEL6.1 and is no longer available.



  =======Package/Yum Related=======

1) What does 'ivh' represents in rpm -ivh <PackageName> command?

ANSWER: i - install
v - verbose mode
h - hash mode where it would print ## characters as the installation progresses

 
2) What is the difference between rpm -F <PackageName> and rpm -U <PackageName>?

ANSWER: rpm -F = Basically freshens a package which in turn upgrades an existing package, otherwise doesn't install it if an earlier version not found.
rpm -U = Upgrades an existing package if exists otherwise install it.

 
3) How to find to which package the "ls" commands belongs to (to find out package responsible for this command)?

ANS : #rpm -qf /bin/ls {this would tell about the package to which this command belongs to if installed by that package}


4) How to find out the configuration files installed by a package (take into consideration of the "coreutils" package)?

ANS : # rpm -qc coreutils

To list out only the document files installed by coreutils package:-
 # rpm -qd coreutils 

To list out all the files installed by this package:-
   #rpm -ql coreutils 
   OR
   #rpm -q --filesbypkg coreutils

To list out the dependent packages:-
   #rpm -qR coreutils

To find out more information of this package:-
  #rpm -qi coreutils


To find out any scripts executed by this package:-
  #rpm -q --scripts coreutils


Similarly, to find details of package which is not yet installed:

List Files In Package:  
   #rpm -qpl <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

{The list would show up files which would get added to system after installing package} 

List Only Config Files:
   #rpm -qpc <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

List Only Document Files:
   #rpm -qpd <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

List Out Dependancies For This Package:
   #rpm -qpR <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>

List Details For This Package:
   #rpm -qpi <PathOfPackageNotYetInstalled>


5) How do you find out all the packages installed on a RHEL system(server)? 

ANS : - /root/install.log > this would only lists packages installed during deployment of the system. Packages installed later would not be listed here.
- Otherwise, run the command #rpm -qa > this would query all packages and prints out names respectively.

- In RHEL 5 we can check the file : /var/log/rpmpkgs to find out all packages on the system. However, this file is deprecated in RHEL6.

- Note: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the daily cron file to create /var/log/rpmpkgs is provided by the rpm-cron package, available in the optional repository, not the main 'rpm' package. So, if you do not install the package, /var/log/rpmpkgs is not available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. (Ref - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/23743)

- In RHEL 6 > yumdb info | grep -v ^\ | grep -v '^$' | sort > /root/yumdblist.out (grep -v '^$' > this deletes empty lines). The file "/root/yumdblist.out" would provide with all the packages installed on the system.

Otherwise,,

One could query the rpm database to list out all package installed:
     #rpm -qa|sort ------ this would show up list of packages installed alphabetically. 


6) How to create a local yum repository which would make use of the mounted linux ISO image under /media ?

ANS : Create files ending with .repo extension under /etc/yum.repos.d directory with proper syntax:

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# cat local.repo
[local]
name=RHEL6.5
baseurl=file:///media
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///media/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release


7) Different ways that can be used to verify that a package got installed successfully via yum:

ANS : ==Method 1==

- Immediately after running yum command, check exit status, if it shows "0" (numeral) then command executed successfully.

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# echo $?
0

==Method 2==
- Run rpm -qa and test.

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# rpm -qa | grep certmonger
certmonger-0.61-3.el6.x86_64

==Method 3==
- Verify with rpm command:

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# rpm -V certmonger

==Method 4==
- Check the yum log to see the successful log entry about the same package.

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# grep certmonger /var/log/yum.log
Jul 15 10:33:22 Installed: certmonger-0.61-3.el6.x86_64 


8)How to view the installed date of a package (consider the package sg3_utils)? 

ANSWER:- Check in /var/log/yum.log file (provided the package is installed by yum):- 

[root@server8 ~]# grep sg3_utils /var/log/yum.log
Oct 22 12:11:38 Installed: sg3_utils-1.28-4.el6.x86_64

OR

Use the command "rpm -q <PackageName> --last" 

 [root@server8 ~]# rpm -q sg3_utils --last
sg3_utils-1.28-4.el6.x86_64                   Wed 22 Oct 2014 12:11:37 PM PDT

OR

Using the "rpm -qi <PackageName> | grep "Install Date" command

[root@server8 ~]# rpm -qi sg3_utils|grep "Install Date"
Install Date: Wed 22 Oct 2014 12:11:37 PM PDT      Build Host: x86-004.build.bos.redhat.com

In RHEL 5.x, one could use /var/log/rpmpkgs file to check this. To get a list of all the packages installed date: #rpm -qa --last


9) If for some reasons, a binary file gets corrupted or missing from the system, then how could this be recovered with minimal downtime?

ANSWER:- In first attempt, one could try to copy the missing binary (executable) file from a similar working system usingscp command.

In next attempt, if the above attempt not possible or doesn't work then we could extract this file from respective package and move it to the system. 

Consider the situation wherein the binary command file /sbin/ifconfig is missing or corrupted, hence, unable to run this command. So, we'd need to extract this from package and install it. 

 Steps
----------

- Identify which package this command belongs to. 

- On a working system, run the command 'rpm -qf /sbin/ifconfig'. This would tell which package has installed this executable file:

[root@rh413server sbin]# rpm -qf /sbin/ifconfig 
net-tools-1.60-110.el6_2.x86_64

- Mount an iso which holds this package and then run "rpm2cpio" command with "cpio" to extract required file.

- Check if the required file is available in the package before extracting it.

[root@rh413server rpm]# rpm2cpio /media/Packages/net-tools-1.60-110.el6_2.x86_64.rpm |cpio --extract --list --verbose "*ifconfig"
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root        69440 Apr 26  2012 ./sbin/ifconfig
1542 blocks

- Now, we know that this binary is available with this package, so we'd need to extract this file. Create a directory where to extract.

[root@rh413server package-restore-test]# rpm2cpio /media/Packages/net-tools-1.60-110.el6_2.x86_64.rpm |cpio --extract --make-directories --verbose "*ifconfig"
./sbin/ifconfig
1542 blocks


- The binary would be found under "sbin" directory within current directory.

[root@rh413server package-restore-test]# tree
.
└── sbin
    └── ifconfig

1 directory, 1 file

- Later, move this binary file to /sbin folder and make sure proper permissions are set as required.



  =======File System/LVM Related=======

1) How to check what file systems are mounted and their read/write status?

ANS : #cat /etc/mtab
#cat /proc/mounts
#mount
#df -Th > this would not tell the read/write status


2) Where is grub.conf file stored in RHEL6/RHEL5 systems?

ANS : In /boot/grub/ directory.


3) How do you remount a file system read only on the fly?

ANS : #mount -o remount,ro <Mountpoint>
- To make a file system gets mounted read only during boot ,need to edit fstab.


4) Command used to convert ext2 file system into ext3.

ANS : tune2fs -j <device or file system name>


5) How to run file system check on a logical volume in rescue mode?

ANS : - Boot into rescue mode ("linux rescue nomount")
- Don't mount any file systems, so "Skip" mounting.
- First make the logical volumes available by running these commands:
- lvm pvscan
- lvm vgscan
- lvm lvscan
- lvm lvchange -ay
- Next, run the file system check on the respective lvm.
- #e2fsck -fy /dev/vgname/lvname


6) How to reduce/extend a root LVM?

ANS : To Reduce - boot into rescue mode without mounting file system (linux rescue nomount).
- activate the lvms if required as explained in previous answer.
- run file system check on respective lvm.
- reduce file system : #resize2fs /dev/vg1/rootlv 5G
- Next, reduce the corresponding lvm : #lvreduce -L 5G /dev/vg1/rootlv (reducing the LV to 5GB)
- Run fsck again.
- Verify the lvm is reflecting the correct size.

To extend - no need to boot into rescue, this could be done online.
- unmount the respective file system first (this is not absolutely necessary, size can be extended online, but always recommended to unmount respective file system)
- Extend the lv : #lvextend -L +1G /dev/vg1/rootlv (extending the size to 1GB plus)
- Extend the file system : #resize2fs /dev/vg1/rootlv
- Run fsck if necessary.


7) How to verify if the filesystem state is marked as clean by fsck/e2fsck or by kernel?

Backup superblock at 884736, Group descriptors at 884737-884737

                       OR
If the file system is un-mounted then could use mke2fs : #mke2fs -n /dev/vg1/rootlv | grep -i -A1 "superblock backup"


9) Find out list of actual devices associated with a logical volume using lvs command?

$ lvs -o +segtype,devices

LV VG Attr LSize Pool Origin Data% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert Type Devices

device = "/dev/sdc" # Hint only


10) How to set "rw" permissions on file for a user and disable for other users except root user (exclusive permissions)? 

ANS : Use "setfacl -m u:<UserName>:<PermissionBits> <File/FolderPath>

 #setfacl -m u:redhat:rw /testfile {redhat is an user here}. 

To read use "getfacl" command: #getfacl /testfile


11) Different fields in /etc/fstab.

ANS : - DeviceName      MountPoint     FilesystemType     MountOptions DumpFrequency     FsckCheckOrder
 
     
12) How do you skip the initial fsck(file system check) on a file system while booting up? 

 ANS : - Edit /etc/fstab and make the last column of the respective file system as 0 (number). This would skip the file system check process.


13) How to list all the files with SUID (Set User ID) bit set under the top level root directory and ignore any errors/warnings in the process, and list the output in long list format? 

ANSWER:- find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l


14) How to list all the files/folders with SUID/SGID/Sticky Bit (Set Group ID) bit set under the top level root directory and ignore any errors/warnings in the process, and list the output in long list format?

ANSWER:- find / -type f -perm /7000 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l


15) How to force file system check to run after random/maximum mount counts? 


ANSWER:- One option is to use "tune2fs" command to set this. There are two options "Maximum mount count:" & "Mount count:" which could be used to control after how-many mounts the file system check should be run. By default the "Maximum mount count:" option would be set "-1" when file system gets created which mask this feature. So, to get a fsck on system reboot/reset this has to be set and which in turn depends on "Mount count". These mount counts would get incremented after each system reset/restart.


Default option:

$ tune2fs -l /dev/sda2 |grep -i "mount count"
Mount count: 9
Maximum mount count: -1

So, to force fsck on count reach of 10, we can tune-up the file system as shown below:

[root@rh413server yum.repos.d]# tune2fs -c 10 /dev/sda2
tune2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Setting maximal mount count to 10
[root@rh413server yum.repos.d]# tune2fs -l /dev/sda2 |grep -i "mount count"
Mount count: 9
Maximum mount count: 10

Now, after the 10th mount of the file system, it would force a file system check and mount counter would be reset to 1. 

Otherwise, there is another global option which could be used to make file system check after 180 days or after random number of mounts using "enable_periodic_fsck" in /etc/mk2fs.conf file as shown below:

[root@rh413server yum.repos.d]# grep -i enable_periodic_fsck /etc/mke2fs.conf
enable_periodic_fsck = 1

NOTE: To get this the e2fsprogs package should be at least "e2fsprogs-1.41.12-20.el6". Hence, need to update older package. This has been added from RHEL 6.6 on-wards. 

Ref: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/428583 



  =======Boot/Kernel Related=======

1) I've installed the latest kernel on the system successfully, however, my server still boots from the old kernel. How do you make the system to boot from the newly installed kernel?

ANS : - Verify if the new kernel packages are installed successfully.
- Verify if the kernel stanza is added in grub.conf file.
- Make the new kernel as the default kernel to boot in grub.conf file. Either move the kernel stanza to be the first or change "default" entry according to the  kernel stanza to boot.


2) There is an error during the boot stating "cannot resolve label for a file system" and system is dropping into single user mode. System would show up  Ctrl+D error. How could this be fixed?

ANS : - Make a note of the file system for which the label failed to resolve.
- Boot into single user mode.
- remount root file system in rw mode = #mount -o remount,rw /
- use "blkid" or "e2label" or "findfs" or "lsblk -f" OR "check in /dev/disk/by-uuid/ or /dev/disk/by-label/" to find out the labels/UUIDs assigned to each mounted devices. If the label is not correct in fstab then edit it.
- Exit and reboot. this would fix the label error.


3) Which command is to be used to create GRUB password to avoid normal user in editing GRUB interface while booting?

ANS :- Using the command "grub-crypt" (in RHEL 6.x). This generates an encrypted password using "sha512" algorithm. You could also use "grub-md5-crypt" which generates "md5" encrypted password.

- paste the generated encrypted password into grub.conf file wherever needed as shown below (only a part of grub.conf file is pasted below):

default=0
timeout=5
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
hiddenmenu
password --encrypted $1$EgrNz1$MbdclVToRCCsOF7OuBEgb/
title Red Hat Enterprise Linux (2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64)

So, with the grub password added anyone who wants to pass arguments to kernel while booting has to enter the password by pressing "P" and then proceed. RHEL 5.x, uses "grub-md5-crypt" command by default to generate one and could use "password --md5 <password-hash>" format in grub.conf file.


4) How do you disable the "NetworkManager" service on runlevel 5?

ANS :- [root@redhat Desktop]# chkconfig --level 5 NetworkManager off

[root@redhat Desktop]# chkconfig --list NetworkManager
NetworkManager 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:off 6:off


5) Which is the parameter that you would add to grub.conf while configuring kdump?

ANS :- crashkernel=128M (for 128MB crash memory) {crashkernel=0M-2G:128M,2G-6G:256M,6G-8G:512M,8G-:768M}

3) How to find out the system hardware details such as "manufacture, product name" etc,.? 

ANSWER: Using "dmidecode" 

#dmidecode --type system |egrep -i "Manufacturer|Product Name|Serial Number|Family"
OR
#dmidecode --type system |grep "System Information" -A 8

- To find out BIOS details : 
                 #dmidecode --type bios |grep "BIOS Information" -A 6

4) The option "Open in Terminal" is missing when user right clicks on terminal in GUI. How to fix this? 

ANS : This is basically because of missing package "nautilus-open-terminal". Once this is installed, the right click option would show up. 


5) How to change the default display manager or desktop from Gnome Display Manager (gdm) to kde?

ANSWER: You would need to install the KDE related packages first. Run command "yum groupinstall "KDE Desktop" to get all the KDE related packages to be installed (provided yum is configured). Once this is done, create the file "/etc/sysconfig/desktop" and add the below lines:

DISPLAYMANAGER="KDE"
DESKTOP="KDE" 

 After this change, restart the X window session.

In RHEL 5.x, you could use "switchdesk" command to switch to different display managers. So, to switch to KDE, you could use the command "switchdesk kde". This may prompt to install "KDE Software Development" group if not installed.

7) How to find out when was the last time a service got restarted? 

ANSWER:- One way is to check in respective configured logs, otherwise, we could find the process start time using "ps" command.

For example, if you wish to find out the restart occurrence of "sshd" then check in /var/log/secure, you would see something similar to below lines:

Jun 18 05:29:18 nagios sshd[5413]: Received signal 15; terminating.
Jun 18 05:29:18 nagios sshd[5612]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
Jun 18 05:29:18 nagios sshd[5612]: Server listening on :: port 22.


Using ps command:

[root@nagios Desktop]# ps -p `ps -C sshd -o pid=|head -1` -o lstart
                 STARTED
Thu Jun 18 05:29:18 2015


Replace the service name with respective service you wish to check far. To find out the most recent 'httpd' service restart time : 

[root@nagios Desktop]# ps -p `ps -C httpd -o pid=|head -1` -o lstart
                 STARTED
Thu Jun 18 05:34:35 2015

Otherwise, check in httpd log files, you would similar lines like below:

[Thu Jun 18 05:34:35 2015] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down
[Thu Jun 18 05:34:36 2015] [notice] Apache/2.2.15 (Unix) DAV/2 PHP/5.3.3 configured -- resuming normal operations




  =======Networking Related=======

1) How do you change the network speed of an interface to 100Mbps with auto-negotiation off and duplex in full mode(example for interface eth0)?

ANS : - #ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 autoneg off duplex full {changing the speed on the fly}
- To make this changes persistent need to add the below line to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file:
ETHTOOL_OPTS="speed 100 autoneg off duplex full"


2) Every time the system reboots the network interface doesn't come up. However, if you restart network service or execute "ifup eth0" command which would bring up the network fine? How could this be fixed?

ANS : Make sure that "ONBOOT=Yes" is set in the respective configuration file (example in ifcfg-eth0 for eth0). In this case the "ONBOOT" parameter would be set to "NO".

- If the above step doesn't help then check /etc/sysconfig/network file and make sure "NETWORKING" is set to "Yes". {These are the most likely reasons in this case}


3) How do you check the network routing table using commands?

ANS : -  #route -n
OR
#netstat -nr

4) After changing the network card on a system the network interface name got changed from eth0 to eth1. This shows when you run the command "ifconfig -a". Running "service network restart", shows this error "Device eth0 doesn't seem to be present". But when you run the command "ifconfig -a" you would notice eth1 is listed there instead of eth0. So, running "ifup eth1" shows error as "configuration for eth1 not found". How to make sure that the network interface becomes eth0 here and up along with the server?

ANS : - Make a note of the HW/MAC address of the second network interface here. {ifconfig eth1}
- Enter this MAC into the field "HWADDR" in ifcfg-eth0 file.
- Now, edit "/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file.
- You comment out the line of eth0 here and change the name of eth1 to eth0. Save and exit.
- Reboot the system. {this should fix the issue, tested on RHEL6.5 system}

5) How to fix/troubleshoot "no network" or "network down" or "unable to ping remote host" or "localhost doesn't ping" problems? 

ANS :- When network is down or unable to ping remote (another) host system, we'd need to start checking the following things sequentially:

    <> Check if local network interface is working properly.

        - Ping localhost to confirm that local network interface is up and required network modules are loaded. If unable to ping localhost check for following things:
        
        <> Check if lo interface is up (ifconfig lo)

            - You should see "UP LOOPBACK RUNNING" line in the output. If not then bring up the loopback interface : #ifup lo

        <>Check if 127.0.0.1 address is mapped with localhost in /etc/hosts file. If there is no such entry then pinging 0 would work, however, pining localhost would fail. So, add the entry as:

            = 127.0.0.1    localhost

    <>  Check if at least one network interface is up on system. 

            #ifconfig eth0 (it could be any interface)

            - This should show up a valid IP address and also would indicate if network is active (UP). If network is down then bring it up:

            #ifup eth0 

        - If unable to get a valid IP address here, then need to check how is IP address being provisioned, it could be static or dynamic. If static then check in
        /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (i've taken eth0 as an example here) and look for valid entries as shown below:
                    
            DEVICE="eth0"
            BOOTPROTO="static"
            HWADDR="00:0C:29:98:64:4C"
            ONBOOT="yes"
            TYPE="Ethernet"
            UUID="99b3f47f-5a68-4ffd-992a-aaa24ad12139"
            IPADDR="192.168.1.211"
            NETMASK="255.255.255.0"

        - Bring up the interface if it is down :#ifup eth0
        - Still unable to bring up network interface then restart the network service             : 
                #service network restart 
                  OR 
                #service NetworkManager restart

        - If it is dynamic mode of IP address then check if there is any problem on the DHCP server. Try to set a test (static) IP address and check if that works.


    <> Next step is to ping the hostname to confirm that name resolution works good.
        
         #ping `hostname` OR ping <IPAddressOfeth0>

        - If the above ping fails then ping the ipaddress directly and test if that works then problem with name resolution (DNS), so it should be either addressed at DNS level or fixing /etc/hosts file.  

    <> Ping another host/node OR Gateway address.
    
      - Now, ping another host/node on the same network group. If ping success then we'd say routing is working, otherwise, check if gateway is configured properly. Ping the gateway address and check.
      
      - Unable to ping another remote host then problem could be at the router end or routing problem. So, run traceroute at this stage and check where network is dropping connections.
      
    <> Unable to ping anything either localhost or remote host or loopback address.

        - This could be a problem either with firewall (iptables rules are set), otherwise, with sysctl settings configured on the system. Check if 
        "net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all" has been set in /etc/sysctl.con file, if so, please un-set this.
        
        - If firewall problem, then make sure "icmp" protocol and "lo" interface is allowed for communication. 

            = iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT {A - Append OR I - Input}

              iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT


  =======Security Related=======

1) How do you backup and restore iptables (configurations)?

ANS : #iptables-save > /tmp/iptables.out
#iptables-restore < /tmp/iptables.out


2) What does the character "S" or "s" in the execute bit location of user permission indicates?
 
ANS : # "S" indicates that the SUID has been set, however, execute permission is not set. "s" indicates SUID has been set with execute permission.


3) How do you provide an user exclusive permissions to shutdown or reboot a system?

ANS : # Make the user sudo with appropriate permissions on the commands required.
- Edit the file /etc/sudoers using the command "visudo".
- Add the below lines to /etc/sudoers file: (example to make user "raj" to execute shutdown/reboot commands)

{format
   <username>                             <host>=<commands>  }

raj      ALL=/sbin/shutdown,/sbin/reboot,/sbin/poweroff

- The next user logins and executes the command "sudo /sbin/shutdown" the user would be prompted to enter password and upon successful authentication the command gets executed.


4) How to disable password-less login for root user in single user mode? 

ANSWER:- Change the line that reads "SINGLE=/sbin/sushell" to "SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin" in "/etc/sysconfig/init" file. 

This prompts for user (root) to enter a valid password to authenticate.  However, if "init=/bin/sh" is passed as grub parameter then system would boot without prompting for password.


       
5) How to temporarily disable all user log-in except root user (either via SSH or terminal or in GUI)?

ANSWER:- This could be achieved by creating /etc/nologin file (as root user). If this file exists then any user who tries to log-in would gets rejected and only root user would be allowed (the root user may not be allowed to login via ssh if "PermitRootLogin" is set to "no" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config).


6) How to disable "Restart" & "Shut Down" buttons on the GUI Login screen? 

 ANSWER: In RHEL 6.x, you would need to use gconftool-2 or gconf-editor commands for this purpose. 

Using gconftool-2 command:

To disable "Restart" & "Shut Down" buttons on the GUI log-in screen, run the below command as root user:

#gconftool-2 --direct --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults --type bool --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_restart_buttons true

These are defined as schemas in "/etc/gconf/schemas/gdm-simple-greeter.schemas" file. 

Same way, if you wish to disable user list, run the below command as root user:

#gconftool-2 --direct --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defautls --type bool --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list true


Using gconf-editor command:

Run "gconf-editor" command, expand "apps" and then "gdm", click on "simple-greeter" and then check "disable_restart_buttons", then right click on "disable_restart_buttons" and choose "Set as Default". 

In RHEL 5.x

The simplest way to achieve this in RHEL 5.x is to run the command "gdmsetup" in GUI as root user, un-check "Show Actions Menu" under "Menu Bar" in "local" tab. This would remove "Restart" & "Shut Down" buttons on the GUI log-in screen.

In RHEL 7.x 

Edit (as root user) "/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-custom-gdm-settings" file and the following lines:

[org/gnome/login-screen]
disable-user-list=true

Then update "dconf" database using the command "dconf update", finally restart gdm service "systemctl restart gdm"


7) What does the umask value of 0022 indicates for a root user? 

 ANSWER:Before understanding this, one must understand the numerical values being used to represent permission bits in Unix environment. It is as shown below:

      r - "read" permission - numerical equivalent value "4"
      w - "write" permission - numerical equivalent value "2"
      x - "execute" permission - numerical equivalent value "1"
      s - "special" permission bit - numerical equivalent "4" for SUID (SetUserID), "2" for SGID(SetGroupID "1" for Sticky-bit.
   
      u - "user"  
      g - "group" 
      o - "others"       
     
      Set/Unset Permissions: Using chmod command. Say for example you wish to set only "read & write (rw)" permission for owner, no permissions for group and others then this could be done like below:
     
      $chmod 600 <filename> OR $chmod u+rw,go-rwx <filename>
     
     
Now, lets check what does 0022 umask value indicates:
   
      0 - Indicates special character bit, not masked.
      0 - Indicates mask nothing, all permission bits are set for "Owner".
      2 - Indicates mask 2 for "Group" (for files it is "x4x" meaning both read & write bits are set likewise for directories it is "x5x" meaning both read & execute bits are set)
      2 - Indicates mask 2 for others ( as explained above)
     
               Saying so, when a root user creates a file/directory this umask bit would be used to set the effective permissions. For a file it would be (666-022=644), rw-,r--,r-- (read&write,read,read) respectively for user, group and others (ugo). However, when a directory is created it would be (777-022=755) rwx,r-x,r-x for ugo. Same way the default umask value for other users is 0002.

(Asked by Silicon Magic Corp. people) Answer: The major advantage of a hash table is its speed. Because the hash function is to take a range of key values and transform them into index values in such a way that the key values are distributed randomly across all the indices of a hash table. Question 2: What are the techniques that you use to handle the collisions in hash tables?(Asked by Silicon Magic Corp. people) Answer: We can use two major techniques to handle the collisions. They are open addressing and separate chaining. In open addressing, data items that hash to a full array cell are placed in another cell in the array. In separate chaining, each array element consist of a linked list. All data items hashing to a given array index are inserted in that list. Question 3: In Unix OS, what is the file server? (Asked by Silicon Magic Corp. people) Answer: The file server is a machine that shares its disk storage and files with other machines on the network. Question 4: What is NFS? What is its job?(Asked by Silicon Magic Corp. people)
3.	3. Answer: NFS stands for Network File System. NFS enables filesystems physically residing on one computer system to be used by other computers in the network, appearing to users on the remote host as just another local disk. Question 5: What is CVS? List some useful CVS commands.(Asked by Silicon Magic Corp.people) Anser: CVS is Concurrent Version System. It is the front end to the RCS revision control system which extends the notion of revision control from a collection of files in a single directory to a hierarchical collection of directories consisting of revision controlled files. These directories and files can be combined together to form a software release. There are some useful commands that are being used very often. They are cvs checkout cvs update cvs add cvs remove cvs commit ^Back to Top Unix/Linux administration interview questions What is LILO? LILO stands for Linux boot loader. It will load the MBR, master boot record, into the memory, and tell the system which partition and hard drive to boot from. What is the main advantage of creating links to a file instead of copies of the file? A: The main advantage is not really that it saves disk space (though it does that too) but, rather, that a change of permissions on the file is applied to all the link access points. The link will show permissions of lrwxrwxrwx but that is for the link itself and not the access to the file to which the link points. Thus if you want to change the permissions for a command, such as su, you only have to do it on the original. With copies you have to find all of the copies and change permission on each of the copies. Write a command to find all of the files which have been accessed within the last 30 days. find / -type f -atime -30 > December.files This command will find all the files under root, which is „/‟, with file type is file. „-atime -30′ will give all the files accessed less than 30 days ago. And the output will put into a file call December.files.
4.	4. What is the most graceful way to get to run level single user mode? A: The most graceful way is to use the command init s. If you want to shut everything down before going to single user mode then do init 0 first and from the ok prompt do a boot -s. What does the following command line produce? Explain each aspect of this line. $ (date ; ps -ef | awk „{print $1}‟ | sort | uniq | wc -l ) >> Activity.log A: First let‟s dissect the line: The date gives the date and time as the first command of the line, this is followed by the a list of all running processes in long form with UIDs listed first, this is the ps -ef. These are fed into the awk which filters out all but the UIDs; these UIDs are piped into sort for no discernible reason and then onto uniq (now we see the reason for the sort - uniq only works on sorted data - if the list is A, B, A, then A, B, A will be the output of uniq, but if it‟s A, A, B then A, B is the output) which produces only one copy of each UID. These UIDs are fed into wc -l which counts the lines - in this case the number of distinct UIDs running processes on the system. Finally the results of these two commands, the date and the wc -l, are appended to the file "Activity.log". Now to answer the question as to what this command line produces. This writes the date and time into the file Activity.log together with the number of distinct users who have processes running on the system at that time. If the file already exists, then these items are appended to the file, otherwise the file is created. ^Back to Top Read more at TechInterviews.com Solaris interview questions 1.

7.	7. Difference Between Linux and Unix 1)Linux default shell is /bin/bash, where Unix default shell is /bin/sh (other shell also supported) 2) Linux Store all their command history,but if the default shell is /bin/sh in Unix, then Unix not store Command history. 3) Linux support Tab key, but unix not support Tab key ------------------------------------- Who owns the data dictionary? The Oracle user SYS owns all base tables and user- accessible views of the data dictionary. Therefore, no Oracle user should ever alter (update, delete, or insert) any rows or schema objects contained in the SYS schema, because such activity can compromise data integrity. The security administrator should keep strict control of this central account. ------------------------------------- which file contains information about os wether it's 32 bit or 64 bit? ANSWER: /proc/cpuinfo or $uname -m or /usr/bin/file -------------------------------- what contains information about file and directory creating time or modification time? An inode is a data structure on a Unix / Linux file system. An inode stores basic information about a regular file, directory, or other file system object. You can use following two commands to display an inode: [a] ls command : list directory contents ----------------------------------- What are RPM?s, what do they offer? The full form of RPM is Redhat Package Manager.
8.	8. rpm is a powerful Package Manager, which can be used to build,install, query, verify, update, and erase individual software packages. A package consists of an archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the archive files. [b] stat command : display file or file system status eg : # stat /etc/passwd Output: File: `/etc/group' Size: 566 Blocks: 16 IO Block: 4096 regular file Device: fd00h/64768d Inode: 2443679 Links: 1 Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root) Access: 2009-08-12 08:23:31.245032672 +0530 Modify: 2002-01-01 05:54:15.000000000 +0530 Change: 2002-01-01 05:54:15.000000000 +0530 -------------------------------------------------- *how to confirm from client end about nfs server sharing? with mount and showmount -e server IP ------------------------------------------------- How do i check which nfs version I am using ? rpcinfo -p localhost | grep -i nfs This cmd is used for nfs version rpm -qa | grep nfs rpm -qi nfs nfs-utils yum info nfs nfs-utils ------------------------------------------------ Through ssh whole directory structure from / is shared regardless the user we have connected with ....... how do i prevent sharing ?? vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config "in last line enter the folowing entry" AllowUsers "username"
9.	9. And vi /etc/hosts.deny "in last line enter the folowing entry" sshd: ALL EXCEPT "DOMAIN-NAME" its benefitial to use setfacl command for secure your stuff.. ------------------------------------------------------- * what restrict telnet for root itself but allow for other user Root can login through telnet session, but by default it is disabled. You can enable by appending /etc/securetty file open /etc/securetty using vi #vi /etc/securetty pts/0 pts/1 don't remove anything from this /etc/securetty , just append your entry vi /etc/pam.d/login auth required pam_securetty.so== 1st line should be placed as required.if we change the option as sufficient instead of required telnet can login as "root". ----------------------------------------------------------- How to send automated email to a set of people at fixed time ? 1)just create a alias of people and create a command file and create a crond entry 2)configure sendmail & postfix to configure procmail.. Or configure Q-mail / Squirrel mail & use contab ---------------------------------------------------- how do i check which package has installed some command suppose ls , mkdir or whatever ??? rpm -qa | grep "pakage name" rpm -qa | grep
10.	10. yum install it will show already installed or not if not then it will install Pirut same as yum rpm -qa /usr/bin/ls gives you from which rpm the "ls" command is installed. ----------------------------------------------------- What is the difference between Telnet and SSH? ssh is a secured shell, where telnet is not a secured one.when you ssh to trasnfer data between a system, the data will be send in the encrypted form, where the hacker cannot encode or decode it. While you telnet,the data send between the system is alphabetical format(ASCII), where every one can understand. More over as per network security, telnet and ftp are prohibited. Always, trust SSL based data transfer. Telnet -> Its just getting (Telenet) a connection to the server. Its not more secure. Anybody can use it. It can be easly hacked.It can be easily read by anybody in that network SSH -> secured shocket shell Its more secure than Telnet . This has an encrption and decrption of the data /usr/pwd None can hack this. It is the good way to transfer the data --------------------------------------------------- What is the difference between home directory and working directory? home directory is one over which user have complete control and it is its default working directory when its logs in. while the working directory is the users current directory which may or may not be his home directory. ------------------------------------------ How can you see all mounted drives? with df -hT command and with the mount command. #vi /etc/fstab contains perminant mounts
11.	11. --------------------------------------------- When you install RedHat what is the kernel mode ? What is kernel compilation / upgrade ? Kernel mode, also referred to as system mode, is one of the two distinct modes of operation of the CPU in Linux. The other is user mode, a non-privileged mode for user programs, that is, for everything other than the kernel. When the CPU is in kernel mode, it is assumed to be executing trusted software, and thus it can execute any instructions and reference any memory addresses. The kernel is trusted software, but all other programs are considered untrusted software. Thus, all user mode software must request use of the kernel by means of a system call in order to perform privileged instructions, such as process creation or input/output. Kernel compilation is installing a new kernel or adding custom modules to the same kernel. Kernel upgradation is upgrading it to a different version altogether. ------------------------------ what is the difference between fork and thread ? and parent and child process in fork system call? fork() system call in UNIX causes creation of a new process the new process (child process) which is an exact copy of the calling process(parent process).return value from fork () is used to distinguish the parent from the child; the parent receives the child's process id, but the child receives zero. A thread is a stream of instructions that can be scheduled as an independent unit. A thread is a stream of instructions that can be scheduled as an independent unit. It is important to understand the difference between a thread and a process. A process contains two kinds of information: resources that are available to the entire process such as program instructions, global data and working directory, and schedulable entities, which include program counters and stacks. A thread is an entity within a process that consists of the schedulable part of the process.
12.	12. A fork() duplicates all the threads of a process. The problem with this is that fork() in a process where threads work with external resources may corrupt those resources (e.g., writing duplicate records to a file) because neither thread may know that the fork() has occurred. When a new perl thread is created, all the data associated with the current thread is copied to the new thread, and is subsequently private to that new thread! This is similar in feel to what happens when a UNIX process forks, except that in this case, the data is just copied to a different part of memory within the same process rather than a real fork taking place. A fork() induces a parent-child relationship between two processes. Thread creation induces a peer relationship between all the threads of a process. -------------------------------------------------------- You want to create a compressed backup of the users' home directories. What utility should you use? Tar -czf kk.tar.gz /home/username If we want to extract the the command is tar -xzf kk.tar.gz -------------------------------------------------------- What is the difference between an argument and an option/switch? A linux/unix syntax format is as follows command option arguement example: ls -a /boot here ls command, -a is option,/boot is arguement option specifies the command how to run arguement specifies the command on what to run --------------------------------------------------------- How does the boot process[init levels] work on Linux? How is it different from Solaris? When an x86 computer is booted, the processor looks at the end of the system memory for the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and runs it. The BIOS program is written into
13.	13. permanent read-only memory and is always available for use. The BIOS provides the lowest level interface to peripheral devices and controls the first step of the boot process. The BIOS tests the system, looks for and checks peripherals, and then looks for a drive to use to boot the system. Usually it checks the floppy drive (or CD-ROM drive on many newer systems) for bootable media, if present, and then it looks to the hard drive. The order of the drives used for booting is usually controlled by a particular BIOS setting on the system. Once Linux is installed on the hard drive of a system, the BIOS looks for a Master Boot Record (MBR) starting at the first sector on the first hard drive, loads its contents into memory, then passes control to it. This MBR contains instructions on how to load the GRUB (or LILO) boot-loader, using a pre-selected operating system. The MBR then loads the boot-loader, which takes over the process (if the boot-loader is installed in the MBR). In the default Red Hat Linux configuration, GRUB uses the settings in the MBR to display boot options in a menu. Once GRUB has received the correct instructions for the operating system to start, either from its command line or configuration file, it finds the necessary boot file and hands off control of the machine to that operating system. 1. The system BIOS checks the system and launches the first stage boot loader on the MBR of the primary hard disk. 2. The Frist stage boot loader loads itself into memory and launches the second stage boot loader from the /boot/ partition. 3. The second stage boot loader loads the kernel into memory, which in turn loads any necessary modules and mounts the root partition read-only. 4. The kernel transfers control of the boot process to the / sbin/init program. 5. The /sbin/init program loads all services and user-space
14.	14. tools, and mounts all partitions listed in /etc/fstab. 6. The user is presented with a login screen for the freshly booted Linux system. ------------------------------------------------------------- What are the main differences between RHEL4 & RHEL5? XEN, YUM and improved SELinux all the features updated with better options Better GUI support then RHEL4 YUM over RPM package management IPTables and SELinux for more secure environment ext2 & ext3 file system In RHEL 4 SELinux Block only 13 services, But on RHEL 5 SElinux Block 80 services ------------------------------------------------------- What text filter can you use to display a binary file in octal numbers? hexdump file1 > file2 -------------------------------------------------------- tell me some of the Linux HotKeys do you know? alt+f1 for application menu ctl+l to clear screen alt+f2 to open run application window alt+f3 for find alt+f4 to close application alt+f9 to minimise window Ctrl-Alt-D Show desktop Crtl-Alt-Backspace Restart XWindows ------------------------------------------------- What file should you examine to determine the defined runlevels for your system? /etc/inittab id:X:initdefault where X=runlevel (ex.0 to 6) 0 =system poweroff 1 = single user mode
15.	15. 2 = multiuser mode without network and X window 3 = multiuser mode with network without X window 4 = unused 5 = X11 (multiuser mode with network and X window 6 = reboot -------------------------------------- What is the name and path of the main system log? /var/log/messages system log messages can be seen here /var/log/dmesg Kernel boot log messages can view There are Three centralized loggin demons 1)syslogd 2)klogd 3)auditd klogd:- collect log file created by the Kernel syslogd:- Collect log file created by the system auditd:- Collect log file created by the SELinux After collecting the log system store logs on different location /var/log/dmesg:- Created at boot time, by kernel /var/log/messages:- standard system error message, /var/log/secure:- authentication related log /var/log/maillog:- Mail related log /var/log/audit/audit.log:-Selinux related log We can redirect the log by configuring /etc/sysconfig/syslog /etc/syslog.conf ------------------------------------------------- what is the difference between semaphore, mutex & spinlock? Kernel Locking Techniques Semaphores in Linux are sleeping locks. Because they cause a task to sleep on contention, instead of spin, they are used in situations where the lock-held time may be long. Conversely, since they have the overhead of putting a task to sleep and subsequently waking it up, they should not be used where the lock-held time is short. Since they sleep, however, they can be used to synchronize user contexts
16.	16. whereas spinlocks cannot. In other words, it is safe to block while holding a semaphore. A "mutex" (or "mutual exclusion lock") is a signal that two or more asynchronous processes can use to reserve a shared resource for exclusive use. The first process that obtains ownership of the "mutex" also obtains ownership of the shared resource. Other processes must wait for for the first process to release it's ownership of the "mutex" before they may attempt to obtain it. The most common locking primitive in the kernel is the spinlock. The spinlock is a very simple single-holder lock. If a process attempts to acquire a spinlock and it is unavailable, the process will keep trying (spinning) until it can acquire the lock. This simplicity creates a small and fast lock. --------------------------------------------------- What are seven fields in the /etc/passwd file. 1. Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length. 2. Password: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. 3. User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1- 99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups. 4. Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file) 5. User ID Info: The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user's full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command. 6. Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes / 7. Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell. ------------------------------------------------------ 1. Q. How do you list files in a directory? A. ls - list directory contents ls -l (-l use a long listing format) 2. Q. How do you list all files in a directory, including the hidden files? A. ls -a (-a, do not hide entries starting with .)
17.	17. 3. Q. How do you find out all processes that are currently running? A. ps -f (-f does full-format listing.) 4. Q. How do you find out the processes that are currently running or a particular user? A. ps -au Myname (-u by effective user ID (supports names)) (a - all users) 5. Q. How do you kill a process? A. kill -9 8 (process_id 8) or kill -9 %7 (job number 7) kill -9 -1 (Kill all processes you can kill.) killall - kill processes by name most (useful - killall java) 6. Q. What would you use to view contents of the file? A. less filename cat filename pg filename pr filename more filename most useful is command: tail file_name - you can see the end of the log file. 7. Q. What would you use to edit contents of the file? A. vi screen editor or jedit, nedit or ex line editor 8. Q. What would you use to view contents of a large error log file? A. tail -10 file_name ( last 10 rows) 9. Q. How do you log in to a remote Unix box? A. Using telnet server_name or ssh -l ( ssh - OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)) 10.Q.

How do you create a symbolic link to a file (give some reasons of doing so)? A. ln /../file1 Link_name Links create pointers to the actual files, without duplicating the contents of
18.	18. the files. That is, a link is a way of providing another name to the same file. There are two types of links to a file:Hard link, Symbolic (or soft) link; 13.Q. What is a filesystem? A. Sum of all directories called file system. A file system is the primary means of file storage in UNIX. File systems are made of inodes and superblocks. 14.Q. How do you get its usage (a filesystem)? A. By storing and manipulate files. 15.Q. How do you check the sizes of all users home directories (one command)? A. du -s df The du command summarizes disk usage by directory. It recurses through all subdirectories and shows disk usage by each subdirectory with a final total at the end.

Interview Questions


What problem did you solve in your career that you are most proud of.  

What is the most rewarding problem that you've overcome in your work?  

	

fork, http, process priority, 




Fizz buzz question. Modifications: 4 and 6 instead of 3 and 5.

Linked, in and LinkedIn instead of Fizz, buz and fizzbuzz.  


Log parsing  


Recursive call of LinkedIn api using REST.  

Parse a log except, providing a csv of the count of each proc per DTTM (SQL???).  

data structure, API, and file system I/O)

  


Print all statistics of every process name and its log for every minute of a piece of system log.
In other word, use minute as row title, print all statistics in the corresponding minutes.  


First was a fizz buzz type question. Second and third were both log parsing.… 



The second round was a technical phone screen with an actual engineer- simple questions: fizz buzz, export to CSV, pull some stuff out of logs… 

How do you write a regular expression for some silly pattern in Python  




Regex it out, add it to a string, call it a day, more or less.



 The second round was a technical phone screen with an actual engineer- simple questions: fizz buzz, export to CSV, pull some stuff out of logs and count it. Not a whole lot of data structures. Like, you had to know dictionaries and stuff for it, but no software engineering style questions. I emailed my recruiter some feedback about the interview, and she emailed me back to put me through to the last (onsite) round. This was scheduled, and they sent a car to pick me up because I don't drive. I met the coordinator, who introduced me to the first engineer I met with, who basically did a deep dive into all the stuff I knew about networking, UNIX, operating systems, parallelism, security, and other relevant stuff. The next engineer presented a case study, focusing on scalability of a simple system. Both engineers were really good at presenting the problems in a clear way.



Question about shell, tcp/ip and Linux internal( fork, etc.)  


I interviewed with an engineer who did a very high-level asking of questions related to web architecture and how I would go about scaling X or Y. It was not very technical, although you were encouraged to speak your mind about technical topics.
Based on the feedback received by that interview we moved on the another phone interview that was a programming interview. You were allowed to pick a language (I picked python) and they asked you 4 questions.

Each question built on the other questions and it was a timed interview (60 minutes). The questions you were asked were taken straight out of CS 101 text books; given input, if input is divisible by 2 do X, if divisible by 6 do Y, if divisible by both do Z, else print something.

Interestingly, because I haven't done any of these "simple" coding problems for upwards of 10 years, I found this portion of the interview the most difficult. For me it was difficult because these questions just are not what you come across in the real world. The majority of the code things I do today involve fixing bugs here and there and monkey patching code to make it work. Also, you typically have some context and foresight into a problem before you start coding. Being dropped a simple 1 + 2 question is nothing you'd ever encounter working in the real world; it's all academic as far as I'm concerned.

I felt like I failed the programming interview, but surprisingly, I got a call back saying they wanted to do an on-site interview.

They flew me out to Mountain View and I spent a full day with a number of their engineers going through what they called "modules". This is where it got interesting.

I took special care to look at their culture. I noticed that the building is very quiet, there is not a lot of personal "schwag" hanging around people's areas. Not a lot of smiling engineers...curious.

The modules included you having semi-technical one-on-one interviews with an engineer. There were some engineers that were VERY technical and weren't much interested in the chitchat that can happen where you talk about what you might currently be working on.

The easiest module was the "lunch" module where you ...well...ate lunch, haha. I was expecting this to be a group thing though and instead it was just a you + 1 engineer who ate at the cafeteria. The engineer was the only one that I really "liked" after meeting them all, but still it was a one-to-one interaction. I was really hoping for a group effort.

Throughout the WHOLE on-site interview process I got the sinking feeling that individuality trumps groups at LinkedIn. This bums me out because I currently operate in a fairly strong group position and if I am moving to a new position where I am more isolated, I really don't want that.

Also, its so quiet. Creepy quiet. Like none of the engineers talk to each other. My current position there is ALWAYS something going on and a lot more background noise to remind you that "you're around people". I didn't get that feeling from LinkedIn.

After the interview I just went back and cooled off in the hotel before my flight left the next day. Because of the 2 hour time difference, it was a good idea to plan for staying 3-ish days; 1 to get there, 1 to interview and 1 to leave.

Interview Questions
There were two and they both happened during the live-debugging portion of the interview.

All of the live debugging questions revolved around a simple website that had something broken in it. You were to fix the brokenness to be able to move on to the next page. In total there were 4 questions, each getting progressively more difficult to debug.

The first question was a simple permissions problem on a file being…

1 Answer
There was a paper presented to you with a number of nagios alerts and you had to rate them in the order you would approach fixing them.

For example, one of them was a production host being 100% offline.

Another was an environment alert about an entire cab that was overheating. Another was the tablet vip being down, another was a load average for the main website being really high.

There were also… 



Asked me how the kernel new to connect to a remote machine. Wasn't too sure if they were asking the lower level c calls, general OS theory, or just basic files / networking components (routing table).
basic monitoring questions like how to monitor query times
Should have said to embed query metric data collection in code but could only think of querying the datastore directly....

I didn't find it too hard, but I do have a problem with writing code / think in front of people in pressure settings such as an interview. The experience was positive, minus one minor thing for one of the questions where I felt the interviewer was confused as to what was expected and did not clarify. Instead, he simplified the problem, which made me insecure as to what result that would have. The coding exercise was done on a collabedit instance while on the phone with the Senior SRE. Both people I spoke to had a nice positive and friendly tone. I would like to try again in the future. 
standard fizzbuzz algorithm. I answered in python.

How Garbage collector in java works internally?  
 DNS lookup question, linux questions about what system calls related to listing files and what tool you can use to check I/O load. I passed this part. As I am a sys admin so this was easy for me.

The second interview was conducted by a junior technical staff in the team. The recruiter has sent me exactly what would be asked. HTTP browser request, how to monitor a website, to distribute loads of files fast and accurrately.

The interviewer did ask all these questions and a bit more. unfortunately I don't have experience with websites. I am more a sys admin. so i was just really guessing what i would have done. like detect via load balancer, error logs in apache etc.

I didn't get to the next stage.
