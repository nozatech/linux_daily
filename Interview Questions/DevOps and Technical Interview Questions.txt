l = ['a','a','b','c','a',]

uniq = set()
dupes = set()

for i in l:
  if i not in uniq:
    uniq.add(i)
  else:
    dupes.add(i)

print len(uniq) - len(dupes)

1) GET		<- Used when the client is requesting a resource on the Web server.
2) HEAD		<- Used when the client is requesting some information about a 
				resource but not requesting the resource itself.
3) POST		<- Used when the client is sending information or data to the serverâ€”for example, 
				filling out an online form (i.e. Sends a large amount of complex data to the Web Server).
4) PUT		<- Used when the client is sending a replacement document or uploading a new document 
				to the Web server under the request URL.
5) DELETE	<- Used when the client is trying to delete a document from the Web server, 
				identified by the request URL.
6) TRACE	<- Used when the client is asking the available proxies or intermediate servers 
				changing the request to announce themselves.
7) OPTIONS	<- Used when the client wants to determine other available methods to retrieve 
				or process a document on the Web server.
8) CONNECT	<- Used when the client wants to establish a transparent connection to a remote host, 
				usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an HTTP proxy.
