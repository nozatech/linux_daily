    """
    Create a CloudWatch alarm for a given instance.  You can choose
    the metric and dimension you want to associate with the alarm
    and you can provide a list of email addresses that will be
    notified when the alarm fires.

    instance_id     The unique identifier of the instance you wish to
                    monitoring.

    alarm_name      A short but meaningful name for your alarm.

    email_addresses A list of email addresses that you want to
                    have notified when the alarm fires.

    metric_name     The name of the Metric you want to be notified
                    about.  Valid values are:
                    DiskReadBytes|DiskWriteBytes|
                    DiskReadOps|DiskWriteOps|
                    NetworkIn|NetworkOut|
                    CPUUtilization

    comparison      The comparison operator.  Valid values are:
                    >= | > | < | <=

    threshold       The threshold value that the metric will
                    be compared against.

    period          The granularity of the returned data.
                    Minimum value is 60 (seconds) and valid values
                    must be multiples of 60.

    eval_periods    The number of periods over which the alarm
                    must be measured before triggering notification.

    statistics      The statistic to apply.  Valid values are:
                    SampleCount | Average | Sum | Minimum | Maximum
